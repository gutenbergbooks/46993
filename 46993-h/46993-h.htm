<h2 id="THE_CAXTONS_PART_XIII">THE CAXTONS.&mdash;PART XIII.</h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXVI">CHAPTER LXVI.</h3>

<p>St Chrysostom, in his work on
The Priesthood, defends deceit, if for a
good purpose, by many Scriptural
examples; ends his first book by asserting
that it is often necessary, and
that much benefit may arise from it;
and begins his second book by saying
that it ought not to be called <i>deceit</i>,
but "good management."</p>

<p>Good management, then, let me
call the innocent arts by which I now
sought to insinuate my project into
favour and assent with my unsuspecting
family. And first I began
with Roland. I easily induced him
to read some of the books, full of the
charm of Australian life, which Trevanion
had sent me; and so happily
did those descriptions suit his own
erratic tastes, and the free, half-savage
man that lay rough and large
within that soldierly nature, that he
himself, as it were, seemed to suggest
my own ardent desire&mdash;sighed, as the
careworn Trevanion had done, that
"he was not my age," and blew the
flame that consumed me with his own
willing breath. So that when at
last&mdash;wandering one day over the
wild moors&mdash;I said, knowing his
hatred of law and lawyers&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas, uncle, that nothing should
be left for me but the bar!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Roland struck his cane into
the peat, and exclaimed, "Zounds,
sir, the bar and lying, with truth and
a world fresh from God before you!"</p>

<p>"Your hand, uncle&mdash;we understand
each other. Now help me with those
two quiet hearts at home!"</p>

<p>"Plague on my tongue! what have
I done?" said the Captain, looking
aghast. Then, after musing a little
time, he turned his dark eye on me
and growled out, "I suspect, young
sir, you have been laying a trap for
me; and I have fallen into it, like an
old fool as I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, if you prefer the bar!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rogue!"</p>

<p>"Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a
clerkship in a merchant's office?"</p>

<p>"If you do, I will scratch you out
of the pedigree!"</p>

<p>"Huzza then for Australasia!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," said my uncle,</p>

<span class="i0">"With a smile on his lip and a tear in his eye;"<br /></span>

<p>"the old sea-king's blood will force
its way&mdash;a soldier or a rover, there is
no other choice for you. We shall
mourn and miss you; but who can
chain the young eagles to the eyrie?"</p>

<p>I had a harder task with my father,
who at first seemed to listen to me
as if I had been talking of an excursion
to the moon. But I threw in a
dexterous dose of the old Greek
<i>Cleruchiæ</i>&mdash;cited by Trevanion&mdash;which
set him off full trot on his
hobby, till, after a short excursion to
Eub&oelig;a and the Chersonese, he was
fairly lost amidst the Ionian colonies
of Asia Minor. I then gradually and
artfully decoyed him into his favourite
science of Ethnology; and
while he was speculating on the
origin of the American savages,
and considering the rival claims of
Cimmerians, Israelites, and Scandinavians,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span>
I said quietly,&mdash;"And you,
sir, who think that all human improvement
depends on the mixture of
races&mdash;you, whose whole theory is an
absolute sermon upon emigration, and
the transplanting and interpolity of our
species&mdash;you, sir, should be the last
man to chain your son, your elder
son, to the soil, while your younger
is the very missionary of rovers."</p>

<p>"Pisistratus," said my father, "you
reason by synecdoche&mdash;ornamental,
but illogical;" and therewith, resolved
to hear no more, my father
rose and retreated into his study.</p>

<p>But his observation, now quickened,
began from that day to follow
my moods and humours&mdash;then he
himself grew silent and thoughtful,
and finally he took to long conferences
with Roland. The result was that,
one evening in spring, as I lay listless
amidst the weeds and fern that
sprang up through the melancholy
ruins, I felt a hand on my shoulder; and
my father, seating himself beside me on
a fragment of stone, said earnestly&mdash;"Pisistratus,&mdash;let
us talk&mdash;I had
hoped better things from your study
of Robert Hall."</p>

<p>"Nay, dear father, the medicine
did me great good: I have not repined
since, and I look steadfastly
and cheerfully on life. But Robert
Hall fulfilled his mission, and I
would fulfil mine."</p>

<p>"Is there no mission in thy native
land, O planeticose and exallotriote
spirit?<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>" asked my father, with compassionate
rebuke.</p>

<p>"Alas, yes! But what the impulse
of genius is to the great, the instinct
of vocation is to the mediocre. In
every man there is a magnet; in that
thing which the man can do best there
is a loadstone."</p>

<p>"Papæ!" said my father, opening
his eyes; "and are no loadstones to
be found for you nearer than the great
Australasian Bight?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, if you resort to irony, I
can say no more!" My father looked
down on me tenderly, as I hung my
head moody and abashed.</p>

<p>"Son," said he, "do you think that
there is any real jest at my heart when
the matter discussed is whether you
are to put wide seas and long years
between us?" I pressed nearer to his
side, and made no answer.</p>

<p>"But I have noted you of late," continued
my father, "and I have observed
that your old studies are grown
distasteful to you; and I have talked
with Roland, and I see that your desire
is deeper than a boy's mere whim.
And then I have asked myself what
prospect I can hold out at home to induce
you to be contented here, and I
see none; and therefore I should say
to you, 'Go thy ways, and God shield
thee,'&mdash;but, Pisistratus, <i>your mother</i>?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, that is indeed the question!
and there indeed I shrink. But,
after all, whatever I were&mdash;whether
toiling at the bar, or in some public
office&mdash;I should be still so much from
home and her. And then you, sir&mdash;she
loves <i>you</i> so entirely, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," interrupted my father; "you
can advance no arguments like these
to touch a mother's heart. There is
but one argument that comes home
there&mdash;Is it for your good to leave
her? If so, there will be no need of farther
words. But let us not decide that
question hastily; let you and I be together
the next two months. Bring
your books and sit with me; when
you want to go out, tap me on the
shoulder and say 'Come.' At the end
of those two months, I will say to you
'Go,' or 'Stay.' And you will trust
me; and if I say the last, you will
submit?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir, yes."</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXVII">CHAPTER LXVII.</h3>

<p>This compact made, my father
roused himself from all his studies&mdash;devoted
his whole thoughts to me&mdash;sought
with all his gentle wisdom to
wean me imperceptibly from my own
fixed tyrannical idea, ranged through
his wide pharmacy of books for such
medicaments as might alter the system
of my thoughts. And little
thought he that his very tenderness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span>
and wisdom worked against him, for
at each new instance of either my
heart called aloud, "Is it not that
thy tenderness may be repaid, and thy
wisdom be known abroad, that I go
from thee into the strange land, O my
father?"</p>

<p>And the two months expired, and
my father saw that the magnet had
turned unalterably to the loadstone in
the great Australasian Bight; and he
said to me, "Go, and comfort your
mother. I have told her your wish,
and authorised it by my consent, for
I believe now that it <i>is</i> for your good."</p>

<p>I found my mother in the little room
which she had appropriated to herself,
next my father's study. And in that
room there was a pathos which I have
no words to express; for my mother's
meek, gentle, womanly soul, spoke
there, so that it was as the Home of
Home. The care with which she had
transplanted from the Brick House,
and lovingly arranged, all the humble
memorials of old times, dear to her
affections&mdash;the black silhouette of
my father's profile cut in paper, in the
full pomp of academics, cap and gown,
(how had he ever consented to sit for
it!) framed and glazed in the place of
honour over the little hearth; and
boyish sketches of mine at the Hellenic
Institute, first essays in sepia
and Indian ink, to animate the walls,
and bring her back, when she sate there
in the twilight musing alone, to
sunny hours when Sisty and the young
mother threw daisies at each other;&mdash;and,
covered with a great glass shade,
and dusted each day with her own
hand, the flower-pot Sisty had
bought with the proceeds of the domino-box,
on that memorable occasion
on which he had learned "how
bad deeds are repaired with good."
There, in one corner, stood the little
cottage piano, which I remembered all
my life&mdash;old-fashioned, and with the
jingling voice of approaching decrepitude,
but still associated with such
melodies as, after childhood, we hear
never more! And in the modest
hanging shelves which looked so gay
with ribbons, and tassels, and silken
cords&mdash;my mother's own library, saying
more to the heart than all the cold
wise poets whose souls my father invoked
in his grand Heraclea. The Bible
over which, with eyes yet untaught to
read, I had hung in vague awe and
love, as it lay open on my mother's
lap, while her sweet voice, then only
serious, was made the oracle of its
truths. And my first lesson-books
were there, all hoarded. And bound in
blue and gold, but elaborately papered
up, <i>Cowper's Poems</i>&mdash;a gift from
my father in the days of courtship&mdash;sacred
treasure which not even I had
the privilege to touch; and which my
mother took out only in the great
crosses and trials of conjugal life,
whenever some word less kind than
usual had dropped unawares from her
scholar's absent lips. Ah! all these
poor household gods, all seemed to
look on me with mild anger; and
from all came a voice to my soul,
"Cruel, dost thou forsake us!" And
amongst them sate my mother, desolate
as Rachel, and weeping silently.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!" I cried, falling
on her neck, "forgive me, it is past,
I cannot leave you!"</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXVIII">CHAPTER LXVIII.</h3>

<p>"No&mdash;no! it is for your good&mdash;Austin
says so. Go&mdash;it is but the
first shock."</p>

<p>Then to my mother I opened the
sluices of that deep I had concealed
from scholar and soldier. To
her I poured all the wild, restless
thoughts which wandered through the
ruins of love destroyed&mdash;to her I confessed
what to myself I had scarcely
before avowed. And when the picture
of that, the darker, side of my
mind was shown, it was with a prouder
face, and less broken voice, that I
spoke of the manlier hopes and nobler
aims that gleamed across the wrecks
and the desert, and showed me my
escape.</p>

<p>"Did you not once say, mother,
that you had felt it like a remorse
that my father's genius passed so
noiselessly away, half accusing the
happiness you gave him for the
death of his ambition in the content
of his mind? Did you not feel a new
object in life when the ambition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
revived at last, and you thought you
heard the applause of the world murmuring
round your scholar's cell? Did
you not share in the day-dreams your
brother conjured up, and say, 'If <i>my</i>
brother could be the means of raising
<i>him</i> in the world!' and when you
thought we had found the way to
fame and fortune, did you not sob
out from your full heart, 'And it is
<i>my</i> brother who will pay back to
<i>his</i> son&mdash;all&mdash;all he gave up for
me?'"</p>

<p>"I cannot bear this, Sisty!&mdash;cease,
cease!"</p>

<p>"No; for do you not yet understand
me? Will it not be better still, if
<i>your son</i>&mdash;yours&mdash;restore to your
Austin all that he lost, no matter how?
If through your son, mother, you do
indeed make the world hear of your
husband's genius&mdash;restore the spring
to his mind, the glory to his pursuits&mdash;if
you rebuild even that vaunted
ancestral name, which is glory to our
poor sonless Roland&mdash;if your son
can restore the decay of generations,
and reconstruct from the dust the
whole house into which you have
entered, its meek presiding angel&mdash;ah,
mother, if this can be done, it will
be your work; for unless you can
share my ambition&mdash;unless you can
dry those eyes, and smile in my face,
and bid me go, with a cheerful voice&mdash;all
my courage melts from my
heart, and again I say I cannot leave
you!"</p>

<p>Then my mother folded her arms
round me, and we both wept, and
could not speak&mdash;but we were both
happy.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXIX">CHAPTER LXIX.</h3>

<p>Now the worst was over, and my
mother was the most heroic of us all.
So I began to prepare myself in good
earnest; and I followed Trevanion's instructions
with a perseverance, which
I could never, at that young day, have
thrown into the dead life of books. I
was in a good school amongst our
Cumberland sheepwalks, to learn
those simple elements of rural art
which belong to the pastoral state.
Mr Sidney, in his admirable <i>Australian
Hand-Book</i>, recommends young
gentlemen who think of becoming
settlers in the Bush to bivouac for
three months on Salisbury Plain.
That book was not then written,
or I might have taken the advice;
meanwhile I think, with due respect
to such authority, that I went
through a preparatory training quite
as useful in seasoning the future emigrant.
I associated readily with the
kindly peasants and craftsmen, who
became my teachers. With what
pride I presented my father with a
desk and my mother with a work-box,
fashioned by my own hands!
I made Bolt a lock for his plate-chest.
And (that last was <i>my</i> magnum opus,
my great masterpiece) I repaired
and absolutely set going an old turret
clock in the tower, that had stood at
two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> since the memory of man.
I loved to think, each time the hour
sounded, that those who heard its deep
chime would remember me. But the
flocks were my main care. The sheep
that I tended and helped to shear,
and the lamb that I hooked out of the
great marsh, and the three venerable
ewes that I nursed through a mysterious
sort of murrain, which puzzled
all the neighbourhood&mdash;are they not
written in thy loving chronicles, O
House of Caxton!</p>

<p>And now, since much of the success
of my experiment must depend
on the friendly terms I could establish
with my intended partner, I
wrote to Trevanion, begging him to
get the young gentleman who was
to join me, and whose capital I was
to administer, to come and visit
us. Trevanion complied, and there
arrived a tall fellow somewhat more
than six feet high, answering to the
name of Guy Bolding, in a cut-away
sporting-coat, with a dog-whistle
tied to the button-hole; drab shorts
and gaiters, and a waistcoat with
all manner of strange furtive pockets.
Guy Bolding had lived a year and
a half at Oxford as a "fast man;"
so "fast" had he lived that there
was scarcely a tradesman at Oxford
into whose books he had not contrived
to run.</p>

<p>His father was compelled to withdraw
him from the university, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span>
which he had already had the honour
of being plucked for the little go:
and the young gentleman, on being
asked for what profession he was
fit, had replied with conscious pride,
"That he could tool a coach!" In
despair, the sire, who owed his
living to Trevanion, had asked the
statesman's advice, and the advice
had fixed me with a partner in expatriation.</p>

<p>My first feeling, in greeting the
fast man, was certainly that of deep
disappointment and strong repugnance.
But I was determined not to be too
fastidious; and, having a lucky knack
of suiting myself pretty well to all
tempers, (without which a man had
better not think of loadstones in the
great Australasian Bight,) I contrived,
before the first week was out, to
establish so many points of connexion
between us that we became the best
friends in the world. Indeed, it would
have been my fault if we had not,
for Guy Bolding, with all his faults,
was one of those excellent creatures
who are nobody's enemies but their
own. His good humour was inexhaustible.
Not a hardship or privation
came amiss to him. He had a
phrase "Such fun!" that always came
to his lips when another man would
have cursed and groaned. If we lost
our way in the great trackless moors,
missed our dinner, and were half-famished,
Guy rubbed hands that
would have felled an ox, and chuckled
out "Such fun!" If we stuck in a
bog, if we were caught in a thunderstorm,
if we were pitched head over
heels by the wild colts we undertook
to break in, Guy Bolding's only elegy
was "Such fan!" That grand shibboleth
of philosophy only forsook him
at the sight of an open book. I don't
think that at that time, he could have
found "fun" even in Don Quixote.
This hilarious temperament had no
insensibility; a kinder heart never
beat,&mdash;but, to be sure, it beat to a
strange, restless, tarantula sort of
measure, which kept it in a perpetual
dance. It made him one of those
officiously good fellows who are never
quiet themselves, and never let any
one else be quiet if they can help it.
But Guy's great fault, in this prudent
world, was his absolute incontinence
of money. If you had turned an
Euphrates of gold into his pockets at
morning, it would have been as dry as
the great Sahara by twelve at noon.
What he did with the money was a
mystery as much to himself as to
every one else. His father said in a
letter to me, that "he had seen him
shying at sparrows with half-crowns!"
That such a young man could come
to no good in England, seemed perfectly
clear. Still, it is recorded of
many great men, who did not end
their days in a workhouse, that they
were equally non-retentive of money.
Schiller, when he had nothing else to
give away, gave the clothes from his
back, and Goldsmith the blankets
from his bed. Tender hands found it
necessary to pick Beethoven's pockets
at home before he walked out. Great
heroes, who have made no scruple of
robbing the whole world, have been just
as lavish as poor poets and musicians.
Alexander, in parcelling out his spoils,
left himself "hope!" And as for
Julius Cæsar, he was two millions in
debt when he shied his last half-crown
at the sparrows in Gaul. Encouraged
by these illustrious examples, I had
hopes of Guy Bolding; and the more
as he was so aware of his own infirmity
that he was perfectly contented
with the arrangement which made me
treasurer of his capital, and even
besought me, on no account, let him
beg ever so hard, to permit his own
money to come in his own way. In
fact, I contrived to gain a great ascendency
over his simple, generous,
thoughtless nature; and by artful
appeals to his affections&mdash;to all he
owed to his father for many bootless
sacrifices, and to the duty of providing
a little dower for his infant sister,
whose meditated portion had half gone
to pay his college debts&mdash;I at last
succeeded in fixing into his mind an
object to save for.</p>

<p>Three other companions did I
select for our Cleruchia. The first
was the son of our old shepherd, who
had lately married, but was not
yet encumbered with children,&mdash;a
good shepherd, and an intelligent,
steady fellow. The second was
a very different character; he had
been the dread of the whole squirearchy.
A more bold and dexterous poacher
did not exist. Now my acquaintance
with this latter person, named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span>
Will Peterson, and more popularly
"Will o' the Wisp," had commenced
thus:&mdash;Bolt had managed to rear, in a
small copse about a mile from the
house&mdash;and which was the only bit of
ground in my uncle's domains that
might by courtesy be called "a wood"&mdash;a
young colony of pheasants, that
he dignified by the title of a "preserve."
This colony was audaciously
despoiled and grievously depopulated,
in spite of two watchers who, with
Bolt, guarded for seven nights successively
the slumbers of the infant settlement.
So insolent was the assault
that bang, bang went the felonious
gun&mdash;behind, before&mdash;within but a
few yards of the sentinels&mdash;and the
gunner was off, and the prey seized,
before they could rush to the spot.
The boldness and skill of the enemy
soon proclaimed him, to the experienced
watchers, to be Will o' the Wisp; and
so great was the dread of this fellow's
strength and courage, and so complete
their despair of being a match for his
swiftness and cunning, that after the
seventh night the watchers refused to
go out any longer; and poor Bolt himself
was confined to his bed by an attack
of what a doctor would have called
rheumatism, and a moralist, rage.
My indignation and sympathy were
greatly excited by this mortifying
failure, and my interest romantically
aroused by the anecdotes I had heard
of Will o' the Wisp; accordingly,
armed with a thick bludgeon, I stole
out at night, and took my way to the
copse. The leaves were not off the
trees, and how the poacher contrived
to see his victims I know not; but five
shots did he fire, and not in vain,
without allowing me to catch a glimpse
of him. I then retreated to the outskirt
of the copse, and waited patiently
by an angle, which commanded
two sides of the wood. Just as
the dawn began to peep, I saw my
man emerge within twenty yards
of me. I held my breath, suffered
him to get a few steps from
the wood, crept on so as to intercept
his retreat, and then pounce&mdash;such
a bound! My hand was on his
shoulder&mdash;prr, prr&mdash;no eel was ever
more lubricate. He slid from me like
a thing immaterial, and was off over
the moors with a swiftness which
might well have baffled any clodhopper&mdash;a
race whose calves are generally
absorbed in the soles of their hobnail
shoes. But the Hellenic Institute,
with its classical gymnasia, had
trained its pupils in all bodily exercises;
and though the Will o' the Wisp
was swift for a clodhopper, he was no
match at running for any youth who
has spent his boyhood in the discipline
of cricket, prisoner's bars, and hunt-the-hare.
I reached him at length,
and brought him to bay.</p>

<p>"Stand back," said he, panting,
and taking aim with his gun; "it is
loaded."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "but though you're
a brave poacher, you dare not fire at
your fellow man. Give up the gun
this instant."</p>

<p>My address took him by surprise;
he did not fire. I struck up the barrel,
and closed on him. We grappled
pretty tightly, and in the wrestle the
gun went off. The man loosened his
hold. "Lord ha' mercy, I have not
hurt you!" he said falteringly.</p>

<p>"My good fellow&mdash;no," said I;
"and now let us throw aside gun and
bludgeon, and light it out like Englishmen,
or else let us sit down and
talk it over like friends."</p>

<p>The Will o' the Wisp scratched its
head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a queer one," quoth
it. And the poacher dropped the gun
and sate down.</p>

<p>We did talk it over, and I obtained
Peterson's promise to respect the preserve
henceforth, and we thereon grew
so cordial that he walked home with
me, and even presented me, shyly and
apologetically, with the five pheasants
he had shot. From that time I sought
him out. He was a young fellow not
four-and-twenty, who had taken to
poaching from the wild sport of the
thing, and from some confused notions
that he had a license from Nature to
poach. I soon found out that he was
meant for better things than to spend
six months of the twelve in prison,
and finish his life on the gallows after
killing a gamekeeper. That seemed
to me his most probable destiny in
the Old World, so I talked him into
a burning desire for the New one:
and a most valuable aid in the Bush
he proved too.</p>

<p>My third selection was in a personage
who could bring little physical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span>
strength to help us, but who had more
mind (though with a wrong twist in
it) than all the others put together.</p>

<p>A worthy couple in the village had
a son, who being slight and puny,
compared to the Cumberland breed,
was shouldered out of the market of
agricultural labour, and went off, yet
a boy, to a manufacturing town.
Now about the age of thirty, this
mechanic, disabled for his work by a
long illness, came home to recover;
and in a short time we heard of nothing
but the pestilential doctrines with
which he was either shocking or infecting
our primitive villagers. According
to report, Corcyra itself never engendered
a democrat more awful. The
poor man was really very ill, and his
parents very poor; but his unfortunate
doctrines dried up all the streams
of charity that usually flowed through
our kindly hamlet. The clergyman
(an excellent man, but of the old
school) walked by the house as if it
were tabooed. The apothecary said
"Miles Square ought to have wine,"
but he did not send him any. The
farmers held his name in execration,
for he had incited all their labourers
to strike for another shilling a-week.
And but for the old tower, Miles
Square would soon have found his way
to the only republic in which he could
obtain that democratic fraternisation
for which he sighed&mdash;the grave being,
I suspect, the sole commonwealth
which attains that dead flat of social
equality, that life in its every principle
so heartily abhors.</p>

<p>My uncle went to see Miles Square,
and came back the colour of purple.
Miles Square had preached him a long
sermon on the unholiness of war.
"Even in defence of your king and
country!" had roared the Captain;
and Miles Square had replied with
a remark upon kings, in general, that
the Captain could not have repeated
without expecting to see the old
tower fall about his ears; and with an
observation about the country, in particular,
to the effect that "the country
would be much better off if it <i>were</i>
conquered!" On hearing the report
of these loyal and patriotic replies,
my father said, "Papæ!" and, roused
out of his usual philosophical indifference,
went himself to visit Miles
Square. My father returned as pale
as my uncle had been purple. "And
to think," said he mournfully, "that
in the town whence this man comes,
there are, he tells me, ten thousand
other of God's creatures who speed
the work of civilisation while execrating
its laws!"</p>

<p>But neither father nor uncle made
any opposition when, with a basket
laden with wine and arrowroot, and
a neat little Bible, bound in brown,
my mother took her way to the excommunicated
cottage. Her visit was
as signal a failure as those that preceded
it. Miles Square refused the
basket; 'he was not going to accept
alms, and eat the bread of charity;'
and on my mother meekly suggesting
that, 'if Mr Miles Square would
condescend to look into the Bible, he
would see that even charity was no sin
in giver or recipient,' Mr Miles Square
had undertaken to prove 'that, according
to the Bible, he had as much
a right to my mother's property as
she had&mdash;that all things should be in
common&mdash;and that, when things were
in common, what became of charity?
No; he could not eat my uncle's
arrowroot, and drink his wine, while
my uncle was improperly withholding
from him and his fellow-creatures so
many unprofitable acres: the land
belonged to the people.' It was now
the turn of Pisistratus to go. He went
once, and he went often. Miles Square
and Pisistratus wrangled and argued&mdash;argued
and wrangled&mdash;and ended
by taking a fancy to each other; for
this poor Miles Square was not half so
bad as his doctrines. His errors arose
from intense sympathy with the sufferings
he had witnessed, amidst the
misery which accompanies the reign
of <i>millocratism</i>, and from the vague
aspirations of a half-taught, impassioned,
earnest nature. By degrees,
I persuaded him to drink the wine and
eat the arrowroot, <i>en attendant</i> that
millennium which was to restore the
land to the people. And then my
mother came again and softened his
heart, and, for the first time in his life,
let into its cold crotchets the warm
light of human gratitude. I lent him
some books, amongst others a few
volumes on Australia. A passage in
one of the latter, in which it was
said "that an intelligent mechanic
usually made his way in the colony,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span>
even as a shepherd, better than a
dull agricultural labourer," caught
hold of his fancy, and seduced his
aspirations into a healthful direction.
Finally, as he recovered, he
entreated me to let him accompany
me. And as I may not have to return
to Miles Square, I think it right
here to state, that he did go with me
to Australia, and did succeed, first as
shepherd, and, on saving money, as
landowner; and that, in spite of his
opinions on the unholiness of war, he
was no sooner in possession of a comfortable
log homestead, than he defended
it with uncommon gallantry
against an attack of the aborigines,
whose right to the soil was, to say the
least of it, as good as his claim to my
uncle's acres; that he commemorated
his subsequent acquisition of a fresh
allotment, with the stock on it, by a
little pamphlet, published at Sydney,
on the <i>Sanctity of the Rights of Property</i>;
and that, when I left the colony,
having been much pestered by
two refractory "helps" that he had
added to his establishment, he had
just distinguished himself by a very
anti-levelling lecture upon the duties
of servants to their employers. What
would the Old World have done for
this man!</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXX">CHAPTER LXX.</h3>

<p>I had not been in haste to conclude
my arrangements, for, independently
of my wish to render myself acquainted
with the small useful crafts that might
be necessary to me in a life that makes
the individual man a state in himself,
I naturally desired to habituate my
kindred to the idea of our separation,
and to plan and provide for them all
such substitutes or distractions, in
compensation for my loss, as my fertile
imagination could suggest. And
first, for the sake of Blanche, Roland,
and my mother, I talked the Captain
into reluctant sanction of his sister-in-law's
proposal, to unite their incomes
and share alike, without considering
which party brought the
larger proportion into the firm. I represented
to him that, unless he made
that sacrifice of his pride, my mother
would be wholly without those little
notable uses and objects&mdash;those small
household pleasures&mdash;so dear to woman;
that all society in the neighbourhood
would be impossible, and
that my mother's time would hang so
heavily on her hands that her only
resource would be to muse on the
absent one and fret. Nay, if he persisted
in so false a pride, I told him,
fairly, that I should urge my father to
leave the tower. These representations
succeeded; and hospitality had
commenced in the old hall, and a
knot of gossips had centred round
my mother&mdash;groups of laughing children
had relaxed the still brow of
Blanche&mdash;and the Captain himself was
a more cheerful and social man. My
next point was to engage my father
in the completion of the Great Book.
"Ah, sir," said I, "give me an inducement
to toil, a reward for my
industry. Let me think, in each tempting
pleasure, each costly vice&mdash;No,
no; I will save for the Great Book!
and the memory of the father shall
still keep the son from error. Ah,
look you, sir! Mr Trevanion offered
me the loan of the £1500 necessary to
commence with; but you generously
and at once said&mdash;'No; you must not
begin life under the load of debt.'
And I knew you were right, and
yielded&mdash;yielded the more gratefully,
that I could not but forfeit something
of the just pride of manhood in incurring
such an obligation to the
father of&mdash;Miss Trevanion. Therefore
I have taken that sum from you&mdash;a
sum that would almost have sufficed
to establish your younger and
worthier child in the world for ever.
To that child let me repay it, otherwise
I will not take it. Let me hold
it as a trust for the Great Book; and
promise me that the Great Book shall
be ready when your wanderer returns,
and accounts for the missing talent."</p>

<p>And my father pished a little, and
rubbed off the dew that had gathered
on his spectacles. But I would not
leave him in peace till he had given
me his word that the Great Book
should go on <i>à pas du géant</i>&mdash;nay, till
I had seen him sit down to it with
good heart, and the wheel went
round again in the quiet mechanism of
that gentle life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span></p>

<p>Finally, and as the culminating
acme of my diplomacy, I effected the
purchase of the neighbouring apothecary's
practice and good-will for Squills,
upon terms which he willingly subscribed
to; for the poor man had pined
at the loss of his favourite patients,
though, Heaven knows, they did not
add much to his income. And as for
my father, there was no man who
diverted him more than Squills, though
he accused him of being a materialist,
and set his whole spiritual pack of
sages to worry and bark at him, from
Plato and Zeno to Reid and Abraham
Tucker.</p>

<p>Thus, although I have very loosely
intimated the flight of time, more than
a whole year elapsed from the date of
our settlement at the tower and that
affixed for my departure.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, despite the rarity
amongst us of that phenomenon a
newspaper, we were not so utterly cut
off from the sounds of the far-booming
world beyond, but what the intelligence
of a change in the administration,
and the appointment of Mr Trevanion
to one of the great offices of
state, reached our ears. I had kept
up no correspondence with Trevanion
subsequent to the letter that occasioned
Guy Bolding's visit; I wrote
now to congratulate him: his reply
was short and hurried.</p>

<p>Intelligence that startled me more,
and more deeply moved my heart,
was conveyed to me some three
months or so before my departure, by
Trevanion's steward. The ill health
of Lord Castleton had deferred his
marriage, intended originally to be
celebrated as soon as he came of
age. He left the university with the
honours of "a double-first class;"
and his constitution appeared to rally
from the effects of studies more severe
to him, than they might have been to
a man of quicker and more brilliant
capacities&mdash;when a feverish cold,
caught at a county meeting, in which
his first public appearance was so
creditable as fully to justify the
warmest hopes of his party, produced
inflammation of the lungs, and
ended fatally. The startling contrast
forced on my mind&mdash;here sudden
death, and cold clay&mdash;there youth
in its first flower, princely rank,
boundless wealth, the sanguine expectation
of an illustrious career, and
the prospect of that happiness which
smiled from the eyes of Fanny&mdash;that
contrast impressed me with a strange
awe: death seems so near to us
when it strikes those whom life most
flatters and caresses. Whence is that
curious sympathy that we all have
with the possessors of worldly greatness,
when the hour-glass is shaken
and the scythe descends? If the
famous meeting between Diogenes and
Alexander had taken place not before,
but after, the achievements which gave
to Alexander the name of Great, the
cynic would not, perhaps, have envied
the hero his pleasures or his splendours,
the charms of Statira, or the
tiara of the Mede; but if, the day
after, a cry had gone forth, "Alexander
the Great is dead!" verily I believe
that Diogenes would have coiled
himself up in his tub, and felt that, with
the shadow of the stately hero, something
of glory and of warmth had gone
from that sun, which it should darken
never more. In the nature of man,
the humblest or the hardest, there is a
something that lives in all of the Beautiful
or the Fortunate, which hope and
desire have appropriated, even in the
vanities of a childish dream.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXI">CHAPTER LXXI.</h3>

<p>"Why are you here all alone,
cousin? How cold and still it is
amongst the graves!"</p>

<p>"Sit down beside me, Blanche; it
is not colder in the churchyard than
on the village green."</p>

<p>And Blanche sate down beside me,
nestled close to me, and leant her head
upon my shoulder. We were both
long silent. It was an evening in the
early spring, clear and serene&mdash;the
roseate streaks were fading gradually
from the dark gray of long, narrow,
fantastic clouds. Tall, leafless poplars,
that stood in orderly level line,
on the lowland between the churchyard
and the hill, with its crown of
ruins, left their sharp summits distinct
against the sky. But the shadows
coiled dull and heavy round the evergreens
that skirted the churchyard, so
that their outline was vague and confused;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">646</span>
and there was a depth in their
gloomy stillness, broken only when
the thrush flew out from the lower
bushes, and the thick laurel leaves
stirred reluctantly, and again were
rigid in repose. There is a certain
melancholy in the evenings of early
spring which is among those influences
of nature the most universally recognised,
the most difficult to explain.
The silent stir of reviving life, which
does not yet betray signs in the bud
and blossom&mdash;only in a softer clearness
in the air, a more lingering
pause in the slowly lengthening day;
a more delicate freshness and balm in
the twilight atmosphere; a more lively
yet still unquiet note from the birds,
settling down into their coverts;&mdash;the
vague sense under all that hush, which
still outwardly wears the bleak sterility
of winter&mdash;of the busy change,
hourly, momently, at work&mdash;renewing
the youth of the world, reclothing
with vigorous bloom the skeletons of
things&mdash;all these messages from the
heart of Nature to the heart of Man
may well affect and move us. But
why with melancholy? No thought on
our part connects and construes the
low, gentle voices. It is not <i>thought</i>
that replies and reasons: it is <i>feeling</i>
that hears and dreams. Examine not,
O child of man!&mdash;examine not that
mysterious melancholy with the hard
eyes of thy reason; thou canst not
impale it on the spikes of thy thorny
logic, nor describe its enchanted circle
by problems conned from thy schools.
Borderer thyself of two worlds&mdash;the
Dead and the Living&mdash;give thine ear
to the tones, bow thy soul to the shadows,
that steal, in the season of
change, from the dim Border Land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>.)&mdash;What
are you thinking of?&mdash;speak, pray!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;I was not thinking,
Blanche; or, if I were, the thought is
gone at the mere effort to seize or detain
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span> (<i>after a pause</i>.)&mdash;I know
what you mean. It is the same with
me often&mdash;so often, when I am sitting
by myself, quite still. It is just like
the story Primmins was telling us
the other evening, how there was a
woman in her village who saw things
and people in a piece of crystal, not
bigger than my hand:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> they passed
along as large as life, but they were
only pictures in the crystal. Since I
heard the story, when aunt asks me
what I am thinking of, I long to say,
"I'm not thinking! I am seeing pictures
in the crystal!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Tell my father that;
it will please him. There is more
philosophy in it than you are aware
of, Blanche. There are wise men
who have thought the whole world,
"its pride, pomp, and circumstance,"
only a phantom image&mdash;a picture in
the crystal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span>&mdash;And I shall see you&mdash;see
us both, as we are sitting here&mdash;and
that star which has just risen
yonder&mdash;see it all in my crystal&mdash;when
you are gone!&mdash;gone, cousin!</p>

<p>And Blanche's head drooped.</p>

<p>There was something so quiet and
deep in the tenderness of this poor
motherless child, that it did not affect
one superficially, like a child's loud
momentary affection, in which we
know that the first toy will replace us.
I kissed my little cousin's pale face,
and said, "And I too, Blanche, have
my crystal; and when I consult it,
I shall be very angry if I see you sad
and fretting, or seated alone. For you
must know, Blanche, that that is all
selfishness. God made us, not to indulge
only in crystal pictures, weave
idle fancies, pine alone, and mourn
over what we cannot help&mdash;but to be
alert and active&mdash;givers of happiness.
Now, Blanche, see what a trust I am
going to bequeath you. You are to
supply my place to all whom I leave.
You are to bring sunshine wherever
you glide with that shy, soft step&mdash;whether
to your father, when you see
his brows knit and his arms crossed,
(that, indeed, you always do,) or to
mine, when the volume drops from his
hand&mdash;when he walks to and fro the
room, restless, and murmuring to himself&mdash;then
you are to steal up to him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span>
put your hand in his, lead him back to
his books, and whisper, 'What will
Sisty say if his younger brother, the
Great Book, is not grown up when he
comes back?'&mdash;And my poor mother,
Blanche!&mdash;ah, how can I counsel you
there&mdash;how tell you where to find
comfort for her? Only, Blanche, steal
into her heart and be her daughter.
And, to fulfil this threefold
trust, you must not content yourself
with seeing pictures in the crystal&mdash;do
you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Blanche, raising
her eyes, while the tears rolled from
them, and folding her arms resolutely
on her breast.</p>

<p>"And so," said I, "as we two, sitting
in this quiet burial-ground, take
new heart for the duties and cares of
life, so see, Blanche, how the stars
come out, one by one, to smile upon
us, for they too, glorious orbs as
they are, perform their appointed
tasks. Things seem to approximate
to God in proportion to their vitality
and movement. Of all things, least
inert and sullen should be the soul of
man. How the grass grows up over
the very graves&mdash;quickly it grows and
greenly&mdash;but neither so quick and so
green, my Blanche, as hope and comfort
from human sorrows."</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXII">CHAPTER LXXII.</h3>

<p>There is a beautiful and singular
passage in Dante, (which has not perhaps
attracted the attention it deserves,)
wherein the stern Florentine
defends Fortune from the popular accusations
against her. According to
him, she is an angelic power appointed
by the Supreme Being to direct and
order the course of human splendours;
she obeys the will of God; she is
blessed, and, hearing not those who
blaspheme her, calm and aloft
amongst the other angelic powers,
revolves her spheral course, and rejoices
in her beatitude.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>This is a conception very different
from the popular notion which Aristophanes,
in his true instinct of things
popular, expresses by the sullen lips
of his Plutus. That deity accounts
for his blindness by saying, that
"when a boy he had indiscreetly promised
to visit only the good," and Jupiter
was so envious of the good that
he blinded the poor money-god.
Whereon Chremylus asks him, whether,
"if he recovered his sight, he
would frequent the company of the
good?" "Certainly," quoth Plutus,
"for I have not seen them ever so
long." "Nor I either," rejoins Chremylus
pithily, "for all I can see out
of both eyes!"</p>

<p>But that misanthropical answer of
Chremylus is neither here nor there,
and only diverts us from the real
question, and that is, "Whether Fortune
be a heavenly, Christian angel,
or a blind, blundering, old heathen
deity?" For my part, I hold with
Dante&mdash;for which, if I were so pleased,
or if, at this period of my memoirs, I had
half a dozen pages to spare, I could
give many good reasons. One thing,
however, is quite clear&mdash;that, whether
Fortune be more like Plutus or an
angel, it is no use abusing her&mdash;one
may as well throw stones at a star.
And I think if one looked narrowly at
her operations, one might perceive
that she gives every man a chance, at
least once in his life; if he take and
make the best of it, she will renew her
visits; if not&mdash;<i>itur ad astra</i>! And
therewith I am reminded of an incident
quaintly narrated by Mariana in
his "History of Spain," how the
army of the Spanish kings got out of
a sad hobble among the mountains at
the pass of Losa, by the help of a
shepherd, who showed them the way.
"But," saith Mariana, parenthetically,
"some do say the shepherd was
an angel; for after he had shown the
way, he was never seen more." That
is, the angelic nature of the guide was
proved by being only once seen, and
disappearing after having got the army
out of the hobble, leaving it to fight
or run away, as it had most mind to.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span>
Now I look upon that shepherd, or
angel, as a very good type of my fortune
at least. The apparition showed
me my way in the rocks to the great
"Battle of Life;" after that,&mdash;hold
fast and strike hard!</p>

<p>Behold me in London with Uncle
Roland. My poor parents naturally
wished to accompany me, and take
the last glimpse of the adventurer on
board ship; but I, knowing that the
parting would seem less dreadful to
them by the hearthstone, and while
they could say, "He is with Roland&mdash;he
is not yet gone from the land"&mdash;insisted
on their staying behind; and so
the farewell was spoken. But Roland,
the old soldier, had so many practical
instructions to give&mdash;could so help me
in the choice of the outfit, and the
preparations for the voyage, that I
could not refuse his companionship to
the last. Guy Bolding, who had gone
to take leave of his father, was to join
me in town, as well as my humbler
Cumberland colleagues.</p>

<p>As my uncle and I were both of one
mind upon the question of economy,
we took up our quarters at a lodging-house
in the City; and there it was
that I first made acquaintance with a
part of London, of which few of my
politer readers even pretend to be
cognisant. I do not mean any sneer
at the City itself, my dear alderman;
that jest is worn out. I am not alluding
to streets, courts, and lanes;
what I mean may be seen at the
west end, not so well as at the east,
but still seen very fairly; I mean&mdash;<span class="smcap">the
House-tops</span>!</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXIII">CHAPTER LXXIII.<br />

BEING A CHAPTER ON HOUSE-TOPS.</h3>

<p>The house-tops! what a soberising
effect that prospect produces on the
mind. But a great many requisites
go towards the selection of the right
point of survey. It is not enough to
secure a lodging in the attic; you
must not be fobbed off with a front
attic that faces the street. First,
your attic must be unequivocally a
back attic; secondly, the house in
which it is located must be slightly
elevated above its neighbours; thirdly,
the window must not lie slant on the
roof, as is common with attics&mdash;in
which case you only catch a peep of
that leaden canopy which infatuated
Londoners call the sky&mdash;but must be
a window perpendicular, and not half
blocked up by the parapets of that
fosse called the gutter; and, lastly,
the sight must be so humoured that
you cannot catch a glimpse of the
pavements: if you once see the world
beneath, the whole charm of that
world above is destroyed. Taking it
for granted that you have secured
these requisites, open your window,
lean your chin on both hands, the
elbows propped commodiously on the
sill, and contemplate the extraordinary
scene which spreads before you. You
find it difficult to believe that life can
be so tranquil on high, while it is so
noisy and turbulent below. What
astonishing stillness! Eliot Warburton
(seductive enchanter) recommends
you to sail down the Nile if you want
to lull the vexed spirit. It is easier
and cheaper to hire an attic in Holborn!
You don't have the crocodiles,
but you have animals no less hallowed
in Egypt&mdash;the cats! And how harmoniously
the tranquil creatures blend
with the prospect&mdash;how noiselessly
they glide along at the distance,
pause, peer about, and disappear. It
is only from the attic that you
can appreciate the picturesque which
belongs to our domesticated tiger-kin!
The goat should be seen on
the Alps, and the cat on the house-top.</p>

<p>By degrees the curious eye takes
the scenery in detail: and first, what
fantastic variety in the heights and
shapes of the chimney-pots! Some all
level in a row, uniform and respectable,
but quite uninteresting; others,
again, rising out of all proportion, and
imperatively tasking the reason to
conjecture why they are so aspiring.
Reason answers that it is but a homely
expedient to give freer vent to the
smoke; whereon Imagination steps
in, and represents to you all the
fretting, and fuming, and worry, and
care, which the owners of that chimney,
now the tallest of all, endured,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span>
before, by building it higher,
they got rid of the vapours! You see
the distress of the cook, when the sooty
invader rushed down, "like a wolf on
the fold," full spring on the Sunday
joint. You hear the exclamations of
the mistress, (perhaps a bride,&mdash;house
newly furnished,) when, with white
apron and cap, she ventured into the
drawing-room, and was straightway
saluted by a joyous dance of those
monads, called vulgarly <i>smuts</i>. You
feel manly indignation at the brute
of a bridegroom, who rushes out from
the door, with the smuts dancing
after him, and swears, "Smoked out
again&mdash;By the Arch-smoker himself,
I'll go and dine at the club!" All
this might well have been, till the
chimney-pot was raised a few feet
nearer heaven; and now perhaps that
long-suffering family owns the happiest
home in the Row. Such contrivances
to get rid of the smoke! It is not
every one who merely heightens his
chimney; others clap on the hollow
tormentor all sorts of odd headgear
and cowls. Here patent contrivances
act the purpose of weathercocks,
swaying to and fro with the wind;
there others stand as fixed as if by a
"<i>sic jubeo</i>" they had settled the business.
But of all those houses that, in
the street, one passes by, unsuspicious
of what's the matter within, there is
not one in a hundred but what there
has been the devil to do, to cure the
chimneys of smoking! At that reflection,
Philosophy dismisses the subject;
and decides that, whether one lives in
a hut or a palace, the first thing to do
is to look to the hearth&mdash;and get rid of
the vapours.</p>

<p>New beauties demand us. What
endless undulations in the various
declivities and ascents: here a slant,
there a zig-zag! With what majestic
disdain yon roof rises up to the left!&mdash;Doubtless,
a palace of Genii or
Gin, (which last is the proper Arabic
word for those builders of halls out of
nothing, employed by Aladdin.) Seeing
only the roof of that palace boldly
breaking the skyline&mdash;how serene
your contemplations! Perhaps a star
twinkles over it, and you muse on soft
eyes far away; while below, at the
threshold&mdash;No, phantoms, we see you
not from our attic! Note, yonder,
that precipitous fall&mdash;how ragged and
jagged the roof-scene descends in a
gorge. He who would travel on foot
through the pass of that defile, of
which we see but the picturesque
summits, stops his nose, averts his
eyes, guards his pockets, and hurries
along through the squalor of the grim
London lazzaroni. But seen <i>above</i>,
what a noble break in the skyline!
It would be sacrilege to exchange
that fine gorge for a dead flat of dull
roof-tops. Look here&mdash;how delightful!&mdash;that
desolate house with no
roof at all&mdash;gutted and skinned by
the last London fire! You can see
the poor green and white paper still
clinging to the walls, and the chasm
that once was a cupboard, and the
shadows gathering black on the aperture
that once was a hearth! Seen
below, how quickly you would cross
over the way! That great crack forbodes
an avalanche; you would hold
your breath, not to bring it down on
your head. But seen <i>above</i>, what a
compassionate inquisitive charm in the
skeleton ruin! How your fancy runs
riot&mdash;repeopling the chambers, hearing
the last cheerful good-night of that
destined Pompeii&mdash;creeping on tiptoe
with the mother, when she gives her
farewell look to the baby. Now all
is midnight and silence; then the red,
crawling serpent comes out. Lo!
his breath; hark! his hiss. Now,
spire after spire he winds and coils;
now he soars up erect&mdash;crest superb,
and forked tongue&mdash;the beautiful
horror! Then the start from the sleep,
and the doubtful awaking, and the
run here and there, and the mother's
rush to the cradle; the cry from the
window, and the knock at the door,
and the spring of those on high towards
the stair that leads to safety
below, and the smoke rushing up
like the surge of a hell! And they run
back stifled and blinded, and the
floor heaves beneath them like a bark
on the sea. Hark! the grating wheels
thundering low; near and near comes
the engine. Fix the ladders!&mdash;there!
there! at the window, where the
mother stands with the babe! Splash
and hiss comes the water; pales, then
flares out, the fire: foe defies foe;
element, element. How sublime is
the war! But the ladder, the ladder!&mdash;there
at the window! All else are
saved: the clerk and his books; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span>
lawyer, with that tin box of title-deeds;
the landlord, with his policy of insurance;
the miser, with his bank-notes
and gold: all are saved&mdash;all, but the
babe and the mother. What a crowd
in the streets! how the light crimsons
over the gazers, hundreds on hundreds!
All those faces seem as one face,
with fear. Not a man mounts the
ladder. Yes, there&mdash;gallant fellow!
God inspires&mdash;God shall speed thee!
How plainly I see him!&mdash;his eyes are
closed, his teeth set. The serpent leaps
up, the forked tongue darts upon
him, and the reek of the breath wraps
him round. The crowd has ebbed
back like a sea, and the smoke rushes
over them all. Ha! what dim forms
are those on the ladder? Near and
nearer&mdash;crash come the roof-tiles.
Alas, and alas!&mdash;no; a cry of joy&mdash;a
"Thank heaven!" and the women force
their way through the men to come
round the child and the mother. All
is gone, save that skeleton ruin. But
here, the ruin is seen from <i>above</i>. O
Art, study life from the roof-tops!</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXIV">CHAPTER LXXIV.</h3>

<p>I was again foiled in seeing Trevanion.
It was the Easter recess, and
he was at the house of one of his brother
ministers, somewhere in the north
of England. But Lady Ellinor was in
London, and I was ushered into her
presence. Nothing could be more cordial
than her manner, though she was
evidently much depressed in spirits,
and looked wan and careworn.</p>

<p>After the kindest inquiries relative
to my parents, and the Captain, she
entered with much sympathy into my
schemes and plans, which she said that
Trevanion had confided to her. The
sterling kindness that belonged to my
old patron (despite his affected anger
at my not accepting his proffered
loan) had not only saved me and my
fellow-adventurer all trouble as to
allotment orders, but procured advice,
as to choice of site and soil, from the
best practical experience, which we
found afterwards exceedingly useful.
And as Lady Ellinor gave me the little
packet of papers with Trevanion's
shrewd notes on the margin, she said
with a half sigh, "Albert bids me say,
that he wishes he were as sanguine of
his success in the cabinet as of yours
in the Bush." She then turned to her
husband's rise and prospects, and her
face began to change. Her eyes sparkled,
the colour came to her cheeks&mdash;"But
you are one of the few who
know him," she said, interrupting herself
suddenly; "you know how he
sacrifices all things&mdash;joy, leisure,
health&mdash;to his country. There is not
one selfish thought in his nature. And
yet such envy&mdash;such obstacles still!
and" (her eyes dropped on her dress,
and I perceived that she was in mourning,
though the mourning was not
deep,) "and," she added, "it has
pleased heaven to withdraw from his
side one who would have been worthy
his alliance."</p>

<p>I felt for the proud woman, though
her emotion seemed more that of pride
than sorrow. And perhaps Lord Castleton's
highest merit in her eyes had
been that of ministering to her husband's
power and her own ambition.
I bowed my head in silence, and
thought of Fanny. Did she, too, pine
for the lost rank, or rather mourn the
lost lover?</p>

<p>After a time, I said hesitatingly,
"I scarcely presume to condole with
you, Lady Ellinor; yet, believe me,
few things ever shocked me like the
death you allude to. I trust Miss Trevanion's
health has not much suffered.
Shall I not see her before I leave England?"</p>

<p>Lady Ellinor fixed her keen bright
eyes searchingly on my countenance,
and perhaps the gaze satisfied her, for
she held out her hand to me with a
frankness almost tender, and said&mdash;"Had
I had a son, the dearest wish
of my heart had been to see you
wedded to my daughter."</p>

<p>I started up&mdash;the blood rushed to
my cheeks, and then left me pale as
death. I looked reproachfully at Lady
Ellinor, and the word "cruel" faltered
on my lips.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Lady Ellinor,
mournfully, "that was my real thought,
my impulse of regret, when I first saw
you. But, as it is, do not think me
too hard and worldly, if I quote the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span>
lofty old French proverb, <i>Noblesse
oblige</i>. Listen to me, my young
friend,&mdash;we may never meet again,
and I would not have your father's
son think unkindly of me with all my
faults. From my first childhood I
was ambitious&mdash;not as women usually
are, of mere wealth and rank&mdash;but
ambitious as noble men are, of power
and fame. A woman can only indulge
such ambition by investing it in
another. It was not wealth, it was
not rank, that attracted me to Albert
Trevanion; it was the nature that
dispenses with the wealth, and commands
the rank. Nay," continued
Lady Ellinor, in a voice that slightly
trembled, "I may have seen in my
youth, before I knew Trevanion, one
(she paused a moment, and went on
hurriedly)&mdash;one who wanted but ambition
to have realised my ideal.
Perhaps, even when I married&mdash;and
it was said for love&mdash;I loved less with
my whole heart than with my whole
mind. I may say this now, for <i>now</i>
every beat of this pulse is wholly
and only true to him with whom
I have schemed, and toiled, and
aspired; with whom I have grown
as one; with whom I have shared
the struggle, and now partake the
triumph&mdash;realising the visions of my
youth."</p>

<p>Again the light broke from the dark
eyes of this grand daughter of the
world, who was so superb a type of
that moral contradiction&mdash;<i>an ambitious
woman</i>.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," resumed Lady
Ellinor, softening, "how pleased I
was when you came to live with us.
Your father has perhaps spoken to
you of me, and of our first acquaintance?"&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady Ellinor paused abruptly,
and surveyed me as she paused. I
was silent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, too, he has blamed me?"
she resumed, with a heightened
colour.</p>

<p>"He never blamed you, Lady
Ellinor!"</p>

<p>"He had a right to do so&mdash;though
I doubt if he would have blamed me
on the true ground. Yet, no; he never
could have done me the wrong that your
uncle did, when, long years ago, Mr
de Caxton in a letter&mdash;the very bitterness
of which disarmed all anger&mdash;accused
me of having trifled with
Austin&mdash;nay, with himself! And <i>he</i>,
at least, had <i>no</i> right to reproach me,"
continued Lady Ellinor warmly, and
with a curve of her haughty lip, "for
if I felt interest in his wild thirst for
some romantic glory, it was but in
the hope that, what made the one
brother so restless, might at least
wake the other to the ambition that
would have become his intellect, and
aroused his energies. But these are
old tales of follies and delusions now
no more: only this will I say, that I
have ever felt in thinking of your
father, and even of your sterner uncle,
as if my conscience reminded me of a
debt which I longed to discharge&mdash;if
not to them, to their children. So
when we knew you, believe me that
your interests, your career, instantly
became to me an object. But, mistaking
you&mdash;when I saw your ardent
industry bent on serious objects, and
accompanied by a mind so fresh and
buoyant; and, absorbed as I was in
schemes or projects far beyond a
woman's ordinary province of hearth
and home&mdash;I never dreamed, while
you were our guest&mdash;never dreamed of
danger to you or Fanny. I wound
you, pardon me; but I must vindicate
myself. I repeat that, if we had
a son to inherit our name, to bear
the burthen which the world lays
upon those who are born to influence
the world's destinies, there is no
one to whom Trevanion and myself
would sooner have intrusted the happiness
of a daughter. But my daughter
is the sole representative of the
mother's line, of the father's name:
it is not her happiness alone that I
have to consult, it is her duty&mdash;duty
to her birthright, to the career of the
noblest of England's patriots&mdash;duty,
I may say, without exaggeration, to
the country for the sake of which
that career is run!"</p>

<p>"Say no more, Lady Ellinor; say
no more. I understand you. I have
no hope&mdash;I never had hope&mdash;it was a
madness&mdash;it is over. It is but as a
friend that I ask again, if I may see
Miss Trevanion in your presence,
before&mdash;before I go alone into this
long exile. Ay, look in my face&mdash;you
cannot fear my resolution, my honour,
my truth. But once, Lady Ellinor,
but once more! Do I ask in vain?"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">652</span></p>

<p>Lady Ellinor was evidently much
moved. I bent down almost in the
attitude of kneeling; and, brushing
away her tears with one hand, she
laid the other on my head tenderly,
and said in a very low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I entreat you not to ask me; I entreat
you not to see my daughter. You
have shown that you are not selfish&mdash;conquer
yourself still. What if such an
interview, however guarded you might
be, were but to agitate, unnerve my
child, unsettle her peace, prey upon"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, do not speak thus&mdash;she did
not share my feelings!"</p>

<p>"Could her mother own it if she
did? Come, come, remember how
young you both are. When you return,
all these dreams will be forgotten; then
we can meet as before&mdash;then I will be
your second mother, and again your
career shall be my care; for do not
think that we shall leave you so long
in this exile as you seem to forbode.
No, no; it is but an absence&mdash;an excursion&mdash;not
a search after fortune.
Your fortune&mdash;confide that to us when
you return!"</p>

<p>"And I am to see her no more?" I
murmured, as I rose, and went silently
towards the window to conceal my
face. The great struggles in life are
limited to moments. In the drooping
of the head upon the bosom&mdash;in the
pressure of the hand upon the brow&mdash;we
may scarcely consume a second in
our threescore years and ten; but
what revolutions of our whole being
may pass within us, while that single
sand drops noiseless down to the bottom
of the hour-glass.</p>

<p>I came back with a firm step to Lady
Ellinor, and said calmly, "My reason
tells me that you are right, and I submit.
Forgive me! and do not think
me ungrateful, and over proud, if I
add, that you must leave me still the
object in life that consoles and encourages
me through all."</p>

<p>"What object is that?" asked Lady
Ellinor, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Independence for myself, and ease
to those for whom life is still sweet.
This is my twofold object; and the
means to effect it must be my own
heart and my own hands. And now
convey all my thanks to your noble
husband, and accept my warm prayers
for yourself and <i>her</i>&mdash;whom I will not
name. Farewell, Lady Ellinor."</p>

<p>"No, do not leave me so hastily; I
have many things to discuss with you&mdash;at
least to ask of you. Tell me how
your father bears his reverse?&mdash;tell
me, at least, if there is aught he will
suffer us to do for him? There are
many appointments in Trevanion's
range of influence that would suit
even the wilful indolence of a man of
letters. Come, be frank with me!"</p>

<p>I could not resist so much kindness;
so I sat down, and, as collectedly as I
could, replied to Lady Ellinor's questions,
and sought to convince her
that my father only felt his losses so
far as they affected me, and that nothing
in Trevanion's power was likely
to tempt him from his retreat, or calculated
to compensate for a change
in his habits. Turning at last from
my parents, Lady Ellinor inquired
for Roland, and, on learning that he
was with me in town, expressed a
strong desire to see him. I told her
I would communicate her wish, and
she then said thoughtfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has a son, I think, and I have
heard that there is some unhappy
dissension between them."</p>

<p>"Who could have told you that?"
I asked in surprise, knowing how
closely Roland had kept the secret of
his family afflictions.</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard so from some one who
knew Captain Roland&mdash;I forget when
and where I heard it&mdash;but is it not
the fact?"</p>

<p>"My uncle Roland has no son."</p>

<p>"How!"</p>

<p>"His son is dead."</p>

<p>"How such a loss must grieve him!"</p>

<p>I did not speak.</p>

<p>"But is he sure that his son is
dead! What joy if he were mistaken&mdash;if
the son yet lived!"</p>

<p>"Nay, my uncle has a brave heart,
and he is resigned;&mdash;but, pardon me,
have you heard anything of that son?"</p>

<p>"I!&mdash;what should I hear? I would
fain learn, however, from your uncle
himself, what he might like to tell me
of his sorrows&mdash;or if, indeed, there be
any chance that"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that his son still survives."</p>

<p>"I think not," said I; "and I
doubt whether you will learn much
from my uncle. Still there is something
in your words that belies their
apparent meaning, and makes me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">653</span>
suspect that you know more than you
will say."</p>

<p>"Diplomatist!" said Lady Ellinor,
half smiling; but then, her face settling
into a seriousness almost severe, she
added, "It is terrible to think that
a father should hate his son!"</p>

<p>"Hate!&mdash;Roland <i>hate</i> his son! What
calumny is this?"</p>

<p>"He does not do so, then! Assure
me of that; I shall be so glad to know
that I have been misinformed."</p>

<p>"I can tell you this, and no more&mdash;for
no more do I know&mdash;that if ever
the soul of a father were wrapt up in
a son&mdash;fear, hope, gladness, sorrow,
all reflected back on a father's heart
from the shadows on a son's life&mdash;Roland
was that father while the son
lived still."</p>

<p>"I cannot disbelieve you," exclaimed
Lady Ellinor, though in a
tone of surprise. "Well, do let me
see your uncle."</p>

<p>"I will do my best to induce him
to visit you, and learn all that you
evidently conceal from me."</p>

<p>Lady Ellinor evasively replied to
this insinuation, and shortly afterwards
I left that house in which I
had known the happiness that brings
the folly, and the grief that bequeaths
the wisdom.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXV">CHAPTER LXXV.</h3>

<p>I had always felt a warm and almost
filial affection for Lady Ellinor,
independently of her relationship to
Fanny, and of the gratitude with
which her kindness inspired me: for
there is an affection very peculiar in
its nature, and very high in its degree,
which results from the blending
of two sentiments not often allied,&mdash;viz.,
pity and admiration. It was
impossible not to admire the rare
gifts and great qualities of Lady Ellinor,
and not to feel pity for the cares,
anxieties, and sorrows which tormented
one who, with all the sensitiveness
of woman, went forth into
the rough world of man.</p>

<p>My father's confession had somewhat
impaired my esteem for Lady
Ellinor, and had left on my mind the
uneasy impression that she <i>had</i> trifled
with his deep, and Roland's impetuous,
heart. The conversation that
had just passed allowed me to judge
her with more justice&mdash;allowed me to
see that she had really shared the
affection she had inspired in the student,
but that ambition had been
stronger than love&mdash;an ambition, it
might be, irregular and not strictly
feminine, but still of no vulgar nor
sordid kind. I gathered, too, from
her hints and allusions, her true excuse
for Roland's misconception of her
apparent interest in himself: she had
but seen, in the wild energies of the
elder brother, some agency by which
to arouse the serener faculties of the
younger. She had but sought, in the
strange comet that flashed before her,
to fix a lever that might move the star.
Nor could I withhold my reverence from
the woman who, not being married
precisely from love, had no sooner
linked her nature to one worthy of
it, than her whole life became as
fondly devoted to her husband's as if
he had been the object of her first
romance and her earliest affections.
If even her child was so secondary to
her husband&mdash;if the fate of that
child was but regarded by her as one
to be rendered subservient to the
grand destinies of Trevanion&mdash;still it
was impossible to recognise the error
of that conjugal devotion without
admiring the wife, though one might
condemn the mother. Turning from
these meditations, I felt a lover's
thrill of selfish joy, amidst all the
mournful sorrow comprised in the
thought that I should see Fanny no
more. Was it true as Lady Ellinor
implied, though delicately, that Fanny
still cherished a remembrance of me&mdash;which
a brief interview, a last farewell,
might re-awaken too dangerously
for her peace? Well, that was
a thought that it became me not to
indulge.</p>

<p>What could Lady Ellinor have
heard of Roland and his son? Was
it possible that the lost lived still?
Asking myself these questions, I arrived
at our lodgings, and saw the
Captain himself before me, busied
with the inspection of sundry specimens
of the rude necessaries an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">654</span>
Australian adventurer requires. There
stood the old soldier, by the window,
examining narrowly into the temper
of hand-saw and tenor-saw, broad
axe and drawing-knife; and as I
came up to him, he looked at me from
under his black brows, with gruff
compassion, and said peevishly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fine weapons these for the son of
a gentleman!&mdash;one bit of steel in the
shape of a sword were worth them
all."</p>

<p>"Any weapon that conquers fate
is noble in the hands of a brave man,
uncle!"</p>

<p>"The boy has an answer for everything,"
quoth the Captain, smiling,
as he took out his purse and paid the
shopman.</p>

<p>When we were alone, I said to him&mdash;"Uncle,
you must go and see Lady
Ellinor; she desires me to tell you so."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"You will not?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Uncle, I think that she has something
to say to you with regard to&mdash;to&mdash;pardon
me!&mdash;to my cousin."</p>

<p>"To Blanche?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;to the cousin I never saw."</p>

<p>Roland turned pale, and, sinking
down on a chair, faltered out&mdash;"To
him&mdash;to my son!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I do not think it is news
that will afflict you. Uncle, are you
sure that my cousin is dead?"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;how dare you!&mdash;who
doubts it? Dead&mdash;dead to me for
ever! Boy, would you have him live
to dishonour these gray hairs!"</p>

<p>"Sir, sir, forgive me&mdash;uncle, forgive
me: but, pray, go to see Lady
Ellinor; for whatever she has to say,
I repeat that I am sure it will be
nothing to wound you."</p>

<p>"Nothing to wound me&mdash;yet relate
to <i>him</i>!"</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey to the
reader the despair that was in those
words.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, after a long
pause, and in a low voice&mdash;for I was
awestricken&mdash;"perhaps&mdash;if he be
dead&mdash;he may have repented of all
offence to you before he died."</p>

<p>"Repented!&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Or, if he be not dead"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush, boy&mdash;hush!"</p>

<p>"While there is life, there is hope
of repentance."</p>

<p>"Look you, nephew," said the
Captain, rising and folding his arms
resolutely on his breast&mdash;"look you,
I desired that that name might never
be breathed. I have not cursed my
son yet; could he come to life&mdash;the
curse might fall! You do not know
what torture your words have given
me, just when I had opened my
heart to another son, and found that
son in you! With respect to the
lost, I have now but one prayer, and
you know it&mdash;the heartbroken prayer&mdash;that
his name never more may come
to my ears!"</p>

<p>As he closed these words, to which
I ventured no reply, the Captain
took long disordered strides across
the room; and suddenly, as if the
space imprisoned, or the air stifled
him, he seized his hat, and hastened
into the streets. Recovering my surprise
and dismay, I ran after him;
but he commanded me to leave him
to his own thoughts, in a voice so
stern, yet so sad, that I had no choice
but to obey. I knew, by my own
experience, how necessary is solitude
in the moments when grief is strongest
and thought most troubled.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXVI">CHAPTER LXXVI.</h3>

<p>Hours elapsed, and the Captain had
not returned home. I began to feel
uneasy, and went forth in search of
him, though I knew not whither to
direct my steps. I thought it, however,
at least probable, that he had
not been able to resist visiting Lady
Ellinor, so I went first to St James's
Square. My suspicions were correct;
the Captain had been there two hours
before. Lady Ellinor herself had
gone out shortly after the Captain left.
While the porter was giving me this
information, a carriage stopped at the
door, and a footman, stepping up,
gave the porter a note and a small
parcel, seemingly of books, saying
simply, "From the Marquis of
Castleton." At the sound of that
name I turned hastily, and recognised
Sir Sedley Beaudesert seated in the
carriage, and looking out of the window
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span>
with a dejected, moody expression
of countenance, very different
from his ordinary aspect, except when
the rare sight of a gray hair, or a
twinge of the toothache, reminded
him that he was no longer twenty-five.
Indeed, the change was so
great that I exclaimed, dubiously&mdash;"Is
that Sir Sedley Beaudesert?"
The footman looked at me, and
touching his hat said, with a condescending
smile,&mdash;"Yes, sir&mdash;now the
Marquis of Castleton."</p>

<p>Then, for the first time since the
young lord's death, I remembered Sir
Sedley's expressions of gratitude to
Lady Castleton, and the waters of
Ems, for having saved him from
"that horrible marquisate." Meanwhile,
my old friend had perceived
me, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What, Mr Caxton! I am delighted
to see you. Open the door,
Thomas. Pray come in, come in."</p>

<p>I obeyed; and the new Lord Castleton
made room for me by his side.</p>

<p>"Are you in a hurry?" said he;
"if so, shall I take you anywhere?&mdash;if
not, give me half an hour of your
time, while I drive to the City."</p>

<p>As I knew not now in what direction,
more than another, to prosecute
my search for the Captain, and as I
thought I might as well call at our
lodgings to inquire if he had not returned,
I answered that I should be
very happy to accompany his lordship;
"though the City," said I,
smiling, "sounds to me strange upon
the lips of Sir Sedley&mdash;I beg pardon,
I should say of Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say any such thing; let
me once more hear the grateful sound
of Sedley Beaudesert. Shut the door,
Thomas; to Gracechurch Street&mdash;Messrs
Fudge and Fidget."</p>

<p>The carriage drove on.</p>

<p>"A sad affliction has befallen me,"
said the marquis, "and none sympathise
with me!"</p>

<p>"Yet all, even unacquainted with
the late lord, must have felt shocked
at the death of one so young, and so
full of promise."</p>

<p>"So fitted in every way to bear the
burthen of the great Castleton name
and property, and yet you see it
killed him! Ah! if he had been but
a simple gentleman, or if he had had
less conscientious desire to do his
duties, he would have lived to a good
old age. I know what it is already.
Oh, if you saw the piles of letters on
my table! I positively dread the
post. Such colossal improvements on
the property which the poor boy had
begun, for me to finish. What do you
think takes me to Fudge and Fidget's?
Sir, they are the agents for an infernal
coal mine which my cousin had reopened
in Durham, to plague my life
out with another thirty thousand
pounds a-year! How am I to spend
the money?&mdash;how am I to spend it!
There's a cold-blooded head steward,
who says that charity is the greatest
crime a man in high station can commit;
it demoralises the poor. Then,
because some half-a-dozen farmers sent
me a round-robin, to the effect that
their rents were too high, and I wrote
them word the rents should be lowered,
there was such a hullabaloo&mdash;you
would have thought heaven and earth
were coming together. 'If a man in
the position of the Marquis of Castleton
set the example of letting land
below its value, how could the poorer
squires in the county exist?&mdash;or, if they
did exist, what injustice to expose
them, to the charge that they were
grasping landlords, vampires, and
bloodsuckers. Clearly, if Lord Castleton
lowered his rents, (they were
too low already,) he struck a mortal
blow at the property of his neighbours,
if they followed his example; or at
their character, if they did not.' No
man can tell how hard it is to do good,
unless fortune gives him a hundred
thousand pounds a-year, and says,&mdash;'Now,
do good with it!' Sedley Beaudesert
might follow his whims, and
all that would be said against him
would be, 'Good-natured, simple
fellow!' But if Lord Castleton follow
his whims, you would think he was a
second Catiline&mdash;unsettling the peace,
and undermining the prosperity, of the
entire nation!" Here the wretched
man paused, and sighed heavily;
then, as his thoughts wandered into
a new channel of woe, he resumed,&mdash;"Ah,
if you could but see the forlorn
great house I am expected to inhabit,
cooped up between dead walls, instead
of my pretty rooms, with the windows
full on the park; and the balls I am
expected to give, and the parliamentary
interest I am to keep up; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>
the villanous proposal made to me
to become a lord steward, or lord
chamberlain, because it suits my rank
to be a sort of a servant. Oh, Pisistratus!
you lucky dog&mdash;not twenty-one,
and with, I dare say, not two
hundred pounds a-year in the world!"</p>

<p>Thus bemoaning and bewailing his
sad fortunes, the poor marquis ran
on, till at last he exclaimed, in a tone
of yet deeper despair,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And everybody says I must
marry, too!&mdash;that the Castleton line
must not be extinct! The Beaudeserts
are a good old family eno'&mdash;as
old, for what I know, as the Castletons;
but the British empire would
suffer no loss if they sank into the
tomb of the Capulets. But that the
Castleton peerage should expire, is a
thought of crime and woe, at which
all the mothers of England rise in a
phalanx! And so, instead of visiting
the sins of the fathers on the sons, it
is the father that is to be sacrificed
for the benefit of the third and fourth
generation!"</p>

<p>Despite my causes for seriousness,
I could not help laughing; my companion
turned on me a look of reproach.</p>

<p>"At least," said I, composing my
countenance, "Lord Castleton has one
comfort in his afflictions&mdash;if he must
marry, he may choose as he pleases."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what Sedley Beaudesert
could, and Lord Castleton cannot
do," said the marquis gravely. "The
rank of Sir Sedley Beaudesert was a
quiet and comfortable rank&mdash;he might
marry a curate's daughter, or a duke's&mdash;and
please his eye or grieve his heart
as the caprice took him. But Lord
Castleton must marry, not for a wife,
but for a marchioness,&mdash;marry some
one who <i>will wear his rank</i> for him,&mdash;take
the trouble of splendour off his
hands, and allow him to retire into a
corner, and dream that he is Sedley
Beaudesert once more! Yes, it must
be so&mdash;the crowning sacrifice must be
completed at the altar. But a truce
to my complaints. Trevanion informs
me you are going to Australia,&mdash;can
that be true?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly true."</p>

<p>"They say there is a sad want of
ladies there."</p>

<p>"So much the better,&mdash;I shall be
all the more steady."</p>

<p>"Well, there's something in that.
Have you seen Lady Ellinor?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;this morning."</p>

<p>"Poor woman!&mdash;a great blow to her&mdash;we
have tried to console each other.
Fanny, you know, is staying at Oxton,
in Surrey, with Lady Castleton,&mdash;the
poor lady is so fond of her&mdash;and no
one has comforted her like Fanny."</p>

<p>"I was not aware that Miss Trevanion
was out of town."</p>

<p>"Only for a few days, and then she
and Lady Ellinor join Trevanion in
the north&mdash;you know he is with Lord
N&mdash;&mdash;, settling measures on which&mdash;but
alas, they consult me now on those
matters&mdash;force their secrets on me. I
have, heaven knows how many votes!
Poor me! Upon my word, if Lady
Ellinor was a widow, I should certainly
make up to her: very clever
woman&mdash;nothing bores her." (The
marquis yawned&mdash;Sir Sedley Beaudesert
never yawned.) "Trevanion has
provided for his Scotch secretary, and
is about to get a place in the Foreign
Office for that young fellow Gower,
whom, between you and me, I don't like.
But he has bewitched Trevanion!"</p>

<p>"What sort of a person is this Mr
Gower?&mdash;I remember you said that
he was clever, and good-looking."</p>

<p>"He is both, but it is not the cleverness
of youth; he is as hard and sarcastic
as if he had been cheated fifty
times, and jilted a hundred! Neither
are his good looks that letter of recommendation
which a handsome face
is said to be. He has an expression
of countenance very much like that of
Lord Hertford's pet bloodhound, when
a stranger comes into the room. Very
sleek, handsome dog, the bloodhound
is certainly&mdash;well-mannered, and I dare
say exceedingly tame; but still you
have but to look at the corner of the
eye, to know that it is only the habit
of the drawing-room that suppresses
the creature's constitutional tendency
to seize you by the throat, instead of
giving you a paw. Still this Mr Gower
has a very striking head&mdash;something
about it Moorish or Spanish, like a
picture by Murillo: I half suspect that
he is less a Gower than a gipsy!"</p>

<p>"What!"&mdash;I cried, as I listened with
rapt and breathless attention to this
description. "He is then very dark,
with high narrow forehead, features
slightly aquiline, but very delicate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span>
and teeth so dazzling that the whole
face seems to sparkle when he smiles&mdash;though
it is only the lip that smiles,
not the eye."</p>

<p>"Exactly as you say; you have
seen him, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am not sure, since you
say his name is Gower."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> says his name is Gower," returned
Lord Castleton, drily, as he
inhaled the Beaudesert mixture.</p>

<p>"And where is he now?&mdash;with Mr
Trevanion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so. Ah! here we
are&mdash;Fudge and Fidget! But perhaps,"
added Lord Castleton, with a
gleam of hope in his blue eye,&mdash;"perhaps
they are not at home!"</p>

<p>Alas, that was an illusive "imagining,"
as the poets of the nineteenth
century unaffectedly express themselves.
Messrs Fudge and Fidget
were never out to such clients as the
Marquis of Castleton: with a deep
sigh, and an altered expression of face,
the Victim of Fortune slowly descended
the steps of the carriage.</p>

<p>"I can't ask you to wait for me,"
said he; "heaven only knows how long
I shall be kept! Take the carriage
where you will, and send it back to me."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, my dear lord,
I would rather walk&mdash;but you will let
me call on you before I leave town."</p>

<p>"Let you!&mdash;I insist on it. I am still
at the old quarters, under pretence,"
said the marquis, with a sly twinkle
of the eyelid, "that Castleton House
wants painting!"</p>

<p>"At twelve to-morrow, then?"</p>

<p>"Twelve to-morrow. Alas! that's
just the hour at which Mr Screw, the
agent for the London property, (two
squares, seven streets, and a lane!) is
to call."</p>

<p>"Perhaps two o'clock will suit
you better?"</p>

<p>"Two!&mdash;just the hour at which
Mr Plausible, one of the Castleton
members, insists upon telling me why
his conscience will not let him vote
with Trevanion!"</p>

<p>"Three o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Three!&mdash;just the hour at which I
am to see the Secretary of the Treasury,
who has promised to relieve Mr
Plausible's conscience! But come and
dine with me&mdash;you will meet the executors
to the will!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Sir Sedley&mdash;that is, my dear
lord&mdash;I will take my chance, and look
in, after dinner."</p>

<p>"Do so; my guests are not lively!
What a firm step the rogue has! Only
twenty, I think&mdash;twenty! and not an
acre of property to plague him!" So
saying, the marquis dolorously shook
his head, and vanished through the
noiseless mahogany doors, behind which
Messrs Fudge and Fidget awaited the
unhappy man,&mdash;with the accounts of
the great Castleton coal mine.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXVII">CHAPTER LXXVII.</h3>

<p>On my way towards our lodgings,
I resolved to look in at a humble
tavern, in the coffee-room of which
the Captain and myself habitually
dined. It was now about the usual
hour in which we took that meal, and
he might be there waiting for me. I
had just gained the steps of this tavern,
when a stage coach came rattling
along the pavement, and drew up at
an inn of more pretensions than that
which we favoured, situated within
a few doors of the latter. As the
coach stopped, my eye was caught by
the Trevanion livery, which was very
peculiar. Thinking I must be deceived,
I drew near to the wearer of the
livery, who had just descended from
the roof, and, while he paid the coachman,
gave his orders to a waiter who
emerged from the inn&mdash;"Half-and-half,
cold without!" The tone of the
voice struck me as familiar, and, the
man now looking up, I beheld the features
of Mr Peacock. Yes, unquestionably
it was he. The whiskers were shaved&mdash;there
were traces of powder in the
hair or the wig&mdash;the livery of the Trevanions
(ay, the very livery&mdash;crestbutton,
and all) upon that portly
figure, which I had last seen in the
more august robes of a beadle. But
Mr Peacock it was&mdash;Peacock travestied,
but Peacock still. Before I had
recovered my amaze, a woman got
out of a cabriolet, which seemed to have
been in waiting for the arrival of the
coach, and, hurrying up to Mr Peacock,
said in the loud impatient tone
common to the fairest of the fair sex,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span>
when in haste&mdash;"How late you are&mdash;I
was just going. I must get back to
Oxton to-night."</p>

<p>Oxton&mdash;Miss Trevanion was
staying at Oxton! I was now close
behind the pair&mdash;I listened with my
heart in my ear.</p>

<p>"So you shall, my dear&mdash;so you
shall; just come in, will you."</p>

<p>"No, no; I have only ten minutes
to catch the coach. Have you any
letter for me from Mr Gower? How
can I be sure, if I don't see it under
his own hand, that"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Peacock, sinking his
voice so low that I could only catch
the words, "no names, letter, pooh,
I'll tell you." He then drew her apart,
and whispered to her for some moments.
I watched the woman's face,
which was bent towards her companion's,
and it seemed to show quick
intelligence. She nodded her head
more than once, as if in impatient
assent to what was said; and, after a
shaking of hands, hurried off to the
cab; then, as if a thought struck her,
she ran back, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But in case my lady should not
go&mdash;if there's any change of plan?"</p>

<p>"There'll be no change, you may
be sure: Positively to-morrow&mdash;not
too early; you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; good-by"&mdash;and the woman,
who was dressed with a quiet
neatness, that seemed to stamp her
profession as that of an abigail, (black
cloak, with long cape&mdash;of that peculiar
silk which seems spun on purpose for
ladies'-maids&mdash;bonnet to match, with
red and black ribbons,) hastened once
more away, and in another moment
the cab drove off furiously.</p>

<p>What could all this mean? By
this time the waiter brought Mr Peacock
the half-and-half. He despatched
it hastily, and then strode on towards
a neighbouring stand of cabriolets.
I followed him; and just as,
after beckoning one of the vehicles
from the stand, he had ensconced
himself therein, I sprang up the
steps and placed myself by his side.
"Now, Mr Peacock," said I, "you
will tell me at once how you come to
wear that livery, or I shall order the
cabman to drive to Lady Ellinor Trevanion's,
and ask her that question
myself."</p>

<p>"And who the devil!&mdash;Ah, you're
the young gentleman that came to me
behind the scenes&mdash;I remember."</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?" asked the cabman.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to London Bridge," said Mr
Peacock.</p>

<p>The man mounted the box, and
drove on.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Peacock, I wait your
answer. I guess by your face that you
are about to tell me a lie; I advise
you to speak the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't know what business you
have to question me," said Mr Peacock
sullenly; and, raising his glance
from his own clenched fists, he suffered
it to wander over my form with so vindictive
a significance that I interrupted
the survey by saying, "Will you encounter
the house? as the Swan interrogatively
puts it&mdash;shall I order the
cabman to drive to St James's Square?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know my weak point,
sir; any man who can quote Will&mdash;sweet
Will&mdash;has me on the hip," rejoined
Mr Peacock, smoothing his
countenance, and spreading his palms
on his knees. "But if a man does fall
in the world, and, after keeping servants
of his own, is obliged to be himself
a servant,</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">---- 'I will not shame<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>"The Swan says, 'To tell you what
I <i>was</i>,' Mr Peacock. But enough of
this trifling: who placed you with Mr
Trevanion?"</p>

<p>Mr Peacock looked down for a moment,
and then, fixing his eyes on me,
said&mdash;"Well, I'll tell you: you asked
me, when we met last, about a young
gentleman&mdash;Mr&mdash;Mr Vivian."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peacock.</span>&mdash;I know you don't want
to harm him. Besides, "He hath a
prosperous art," and one day or other,&mdash;mark
my words, or rather my friend
Will's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peacock</span> (<i>snappishly</i>.)&mdash;I am going

was I&mdash;oh&mdash;ah yes. I had just been
sold up&mdash;not a penny in my pocket;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>
and if you could have seen my coat&mdash;yet
that was better than the small-clothes!

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>I will go on&mdash;honour bright. So I
met Mr Vivian, and as he had known
me in better days, and has a good
heart of his own, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Horatio,&mdash;or I do forget myself."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pisistratus puts his hand on the
check-string.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peacock.</span>&mdash;I mean, (<i>correcting
himself</i>)&mdash;"Why, Johnson, my good
fellow."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Johnson!&mdash;oh that's
your name&mdash;not Peacock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peacock.</span>&mdash;Johnson and Peacock
both, (<i>with dignity</i>.) When you know
the world as I do, sir, you will find
that it is ill travelling this "naughty
world" without a change of names in
your portmanteau.</p>

<p>"Johnson," says he, "my good
fellow," and he pulled out his purse.
"Sir," said I, "if, 'exempt from public
haunt,' I could get something to do
when this dross is gone. In London
there are sermons in stones, certainly,
but not 'good in everything,'&mdash;an
observation I should take the liberty
of making to the Swan, if he were not
now, alas! 'the baseless fabric of a
vision.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;Take care!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peacock</span>&mdash;(<i>hurriedly</i>.)&mdash;Then
says Mr Vivian, "If you don't mind
wearing a livery, till I can provide
for you more suitably, my old friend,
there's a vacancy in the establishment
of Mr Trevanion." Sir, I accepted the
proposal, and that's why I wear this
livery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;And, pray, what
business had you with that young
woman, whom I take to be Miss
Trevanion's maid?&mdash;and why should
she come from Oxton to see you?</p>

<p>I had expected that these questions
would confound Mr Peacock, but if
there really were anything in them
to cause embarrassment, the <i>ci-devant</i>
actor was too practised in his profession
to exhibit it. He merely smiled,
and smoothing jauntily a very tumbled
shirt-front, he said, "Oh sir,
fie!</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">'Of this matter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>If you must know my love affairs,
that young woman is, as the vulgar
say, my sweetheart."</p>

<p>"Your sweetheart!" I exclaimed,
greatly relieved, and acknowledging
at once the probability of the statement.
"Yet," I added suspiciously&mdash;"yet,
if so, why should she expect
Mr Gower to write to her?"</p>

<p>"You're quick of hearing, sir; but
though</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'All adoration, duty, and observance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All humbleness, and patience, and impatience,'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>the young woman will not marry a
livery servant&mdash;proud creature, very
proud!&mdash;and Mr Gower, you see,
knowing how it was, felt for me, and
told her, if I may take such liberty
with the Swan, that she should</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;'Never lie by Johnson's side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an unquiet soul,'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>for that he would get me a place in
the Stamps! The silly girl said she
would have it in black and white&mdash;as
if Mr Gower would write to her!"</p>

<p>"And now, sir," continued Mr Peacock,
with a simpler gravity, "you
are at liberty, of course, to say what
you please to my lady, but I hope
you'll not try to take the bread out of
my mouth because I wear a livery,
and am fool enough to be in love with
a waiting-woman&mdash;I, sir, who could
have married ladies who have played
the first parts in life&mdash;on the metropolitan
stage."</p>

<p>I had nothing to say to these representations&mdash;they
seemed plausible;
and though at first I had suspected that
the man had only resorted to the
buffoonery of his quotations in order
to gain time for invention, or to divert
my notice from any flaw in his
narrative, yet at the close, as the
narrative seemed probable, so I was
willing to believe that the buffoonery
was merely characteristic. I contented
myself therefore with asking&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span></p>

<p>"Where do you come from now?"</p>

<p>"From Mr Trevanion, in the country,
with letters to Lady Ellinor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, and so the young woman
knew you were coming to town?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; some days ago. Mr
Trevanion told me the day I should
have to start."</p>

<p>"And what do you and the young
woman propose doing to-morrow, if
there is no change of plan?"</p>

<p>Here I certainly thought there was
a slight, scarce perceptible, alteration
in Mr Peacock's countenance, but he
answered readily, "To-morrow? a
little assignation, if we can both get
out;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Woo me, now I am in a holiday humour,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Swan again, sir!"</p>

<p>"Humph!&mdash;so then Mr Gower
and Mr Vivian are the same person."</p>

<p>Peacock hesitated. "That's not <i>my</i>
secret, sir; 'I am combined by a sacred
vow.' You are too much the gentleman
to peep through the blanket of the
dark, and to ask me, who wear the
whips and stripes&mdash;I mean the plush
small-clothes and shoulder-knots&mdash;the
secrets of another gent, to whom
'my services are bound.'"</p>

<p>How a man past thirty foils a man
scarcely twenty!&mdash;what superiority
the mere fact of living-on gives to
the dullest dog! I bit my lip, and
was silent.</p>

<p>"And," pursued Mr Peacock, "if
you knew how the Mr Vivian you
inquired after loves you"! When I
told him incidentally, how a young
gentleman had come behind the scenes
to inquire after him, he made me
describe you, and then said, quite
mournfully, 'If ever I am what I
hope to become, how happy I shall
be to shake that kind hand once
more,'&mdash;very words, sir!&mdash;honour
bright!</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I think there's ne'er a man in Christendom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can lesser hide his hate or love than he.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And if Mr Vivian has some
reason to keep himself concealed
still&mdash;if his fortune or ruin depend
on your not divulging his secret for
awhile&mdash;I can't think you are the
man he need fear. 'Pon my life,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I wish I was as sure of a good dinner,'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>as the Swan touchingly exclaims. I
dare swear that was a wish often on
the Swan's lips in the privacy of his
domestic life!"</p>

<p>My heart was softened, not by the
pathos of the much profaned and desecrated
Swan, but by Mr Peacock's unadorned
repetition of Vivian's words;
I turned my face from the sharp eyes
of my companion&mdash;the cab now stopped
at the foot of London Bridge.</p>

<p>I had no more to ask, yet still there
was some uneasy curiosity in my mind,
which I could hardly define to myself,&mdash;was
it not jealousy? Vivian, so
handsome and so daring&mdash;<i>he</i> at least
might see the great heiress; Lady
Ellinor perhaps thought of no danger
there. But&mdash;I&mdash;I was a lover still,
and&mdash;nay, such thoughts were folly
indeed!</p>

<p>"My man," said I to the ex-comedian,
"I neither wish to harm Mr
Vivian (if I am so to call him,) nor
you who imitate him in the variety of
your names. But I tell you, fairly,
that I do not like your being in Mr
Trevanion's employment, and I advise
you to get out of it as soon as possible.
I say nothing more as yet,
for I shall take time to consider well
what you have told me."</p>

<p>With that I hastened away, and
Mr Peacock continued his solitary
journey over London Bridge.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXVIII">CHAPTER LXXVIII.</h3>

<p>Amidst all that lacerated my heart,
or tormented my thoughts, that eventful
day, I felt at least one joyous
emotion, when, on entering our little
drawing-room, I found my uncle seated
there.</p>

<p>The Captain had placed before him
on the table a large Bible, borrowed
from the landlady. He never travelled,
to be sure, without his own Bible,
but the print of that was small, and
the Captain's eyes began to fail him
at night. So this was a Bible with
large type; and a candle was placed
on either side of it; and the Captain
leant his elbows on the table, and
both his hands were tightly clasped
upon his forehead&mdash;tightly, as if to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span>
shut out the tempter, and <i>force</i> his
whole soul upon the page.</p>

<p>He sate, the image of iron courage;
in every line of that rigid form there
was resolution. "I will <i>not</i> listen to
my heart; I <i>will</i> read the Book, and
learn to suffer as becomes a Christian
man."</p>

<p>There was such a pathos in the
stern sufferer's attitude, that it spoke
those words as plainly as if his lips
had said them.</p>

<p>Old soldier! thou hast done a soldier's
part in many a bloody field;
but if I could make visible to the
world thy brave soldier's soul, I would
paint thee as I saw thee then!&mdash;Out
on this tyro's hand!</p>

<p>At the movement I made, the Captain
looked up, and the strife he had
gone through was written upon his
face.</p>

<p>"It has done me good," said he
simply, and he closed the book.</p>

<p>I drew my chair near to him, and
hung my arm over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"No cheering news then?" asked
I in a whisper.</p>

<p>Roland shook his head, and gently
laid his finger on his lips.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_LXXIX">CHAPTER LXXIX.</h3>

<p>It was impossible for me to intrude
upon Roland's thoughts, whatever
their nature, with a detail of those
circumstances which had roused in
me a keen and anxious interest in
things apart from his sorrow.</p>

<p>Yet, as "restless I roll'd around my
weary bed," and revolved the renewal
of Vivian's connexion with a man of
character so equivocal as Peacock, the
establishment of an able and unscrupulous
tool of his own in the service of
Trevanion, the care with which he
had concealed from me his change of
name, and his intimacy at the very
house to which I had frankly offered
to present him; the familiarity which
his creature had contrived to effect
with Miss Trevanion's maid, the
words that had passed between them&mdash;plausibly
accounted for, it is true, yet
still suspicious&mdash;and, above all, my
painful recollections of Vivian's reckless
ambition, and unprincipled sentiments&mdash;nay,
the effect that a few
random words upon Fanny's fortune,
and the luck of winning an heiress,
had sufficed to produce upon his heated
fancy and audacious temper: when
all these thoughts came upon me,
strong and vivid, in the darkness of
night, I longed for some confidant,
more experienced in the world than
myself, to advise me as to the course
I ought to pursue. Should I warn
Lady Ellinor? But of what?&mdash;the
character of a servant, or the designs
of the fictitious Gower? Against the
first I could say, if nothing very positive,
still enough to make it prudent
to dismiss him. But of Gower or
Vivian, what could I say without, not
indeed betraying his confidence&mdash;for
that he had never given me&mdash;but without
belying the professions of friendship
that I myself had lavishly made
to him? Perhaps, after all, he might
have disclosed whatever were his real
secrets to Trevanion; and, if not, I
might indeed ruin his prospects by
revealing the aliases he assumed.
But wherefore reveal, and wherefore
warn? Because of suspicions that
I could not myself analyse&mdash;suspicions
founded on circumstances most
of which had already been seemingly
explained away? Still, when morning
came, I was irresolute what to do;
and after watching Roland's countenance,
and seeing on his brow so great
a weight of care, that I had no option
but to postpone the confidence I pined
to place in his strong understanding
and unerring sense of honour, I wandered
out, hoping that in the fresh air
I might re-collect my thoughts, and
solve the problem that perplexed me.
I had enough to do in sundry small
orders for my voyage, and commissions
for Bolding, to occupy me some
hours. And, this business done, I
found myself moving westward; mechanically,
as it were, I had come to
a kind of half-and-half resolution to
call upon Lady Ellinor, and question
her, carelessly and incidentally, both
about Gower and the new servant
admitted to the household.</p>

<p>Thus I found myself in Regent Street,
when a carriage, borne by post-horses,
whirled rapidly over the pavement&mdash;scattering
to the right and left all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span>
humbler equipages&mdash;and hurried, as if
on an errand of life and death, up the
broad thoroughfare leading into Portland
Place. But, rapidly as the wheels
dashed by, I had seen distinctly the
face of Fanny Trevanion in the carriage,
and that face wore a strange
expression, which seemed to me to
speak of anxiety and grief; and, by
her side&mdash;was not that the woman I
had seen with Peacock? I did not see
the face of the woman, but I thought
I recognised the cloak, the bonnet,
and peculiar turn of the head. If
I could be mistaken there, I was not
mistaken at least as to the servant on
the seat behind. Looking back at a
butcher's boy, who had just escaped
being run over, and was revenging
himself by all the imprecations the
Diræ of London slang could suggest,
the face of Mr Peacock was exposed
in full to my gaze.</p>

<p>My first impulse, on recovering my
surprise, was to spring after the carriage;
in the haste of that impulse, I
cried "Stop!" But the carriage was
out of sight in a moment, and my word
was lost in air. After pausing for a
moment, full of presentiments of some
evil&mdash;I knew not what&mdash;I then altered
my course, and stopped not till I found
myself, panting and out of breath, in
St James's Square&mdash;at the door of
Trevanion's house&mdash;in the hall. The
porter had a newspaper in his hand as
he admitted me.</p>

<p>"Where is Lady Ellinor? I must
see her instantly."</p>

<p>"No worse news of master, I hope,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Worse news of what?&mdash;of whom?&mdash;of
Mr Trevanion?"</p>

<p>"Did you not know he was suddenly
taken ill, sir; that a servant
came express to say so last night.
Lady Ellinor went off at ten o'clock
to join him."</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; the servant's account
alarmed her ladyship so much."</p>

<p>"The new servant, who had been
recommended by Mr Gower?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;Henry," answered the
porter staring at me. "Please, sir,
here is an account of master's attack
in the paper. I suppose Henry took
it to the office before he came here,
which was very wrong in him; but I
am afraid he's a very foolish fellow."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Miss Trevanion&mdash;I
saw her just now&mdash;<i>she</i> did not go
with her mother; Where was she
going, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir&mdash;but pray step into the
parlour."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;speak."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, before Lady Ellinor set
out, she was afraid that there <i>might</i>
be something in the papers to alarm
Miss Trevanion, and so she sent Henry
down to Lady Castleton's, to beg her
ladyship to make as light of it as she
could; but it seems that Henry
blabbed the worst to Mrs Mole,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is Mrs Mole?"</p>

<p>"Miss Trevanion's maid, sir&mdash;a
new maid; and Mrs Mole blabbed
to my young lady, and so she took
fright, and insisted on coming to
town. And Lady Castleton, who is
ill herself in bed, could not keep
her, I suppose&mdash;especially as Henry
said, though he ought to have known
better, 'that she would be in time
to arrive before my lady set off.'
Poor Miss Trevanion was so disappointed
when she found her mamma
gone. And then she would order
fresh horses, and would go on,
though Mrs Bates (the housekeeper,
you know, sir) was very angry with
Mrs Mole, who encouraged Miss;
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Why did not
Mrs Bates go with her?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, you know how old Mrs
Bates is, and my young lady is always
so kind that she would not hear of it,
as she is going to travel night and
day; and Mrs Mole said she had
gone all over the world with her last
lady, and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see it all. Where is Mr
Gower?"</p>

<p>"Mr Gower, sir!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Can't you answer?"</p>

<p>"Why, with Mr Trevanion, I believe,
sir."</p>

<p>"In the north&mdash;what is the address?"</p>

<p>"Lord N&mdash;&mdash;, C&mdash;&mdash; Hall, near
W&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I heard no more.</p>

<p>The conviction of some villanous
snare struck me as with the swiftness
and force of lightning. Why, if Trevanion
were really ill, had the false
servant concealed it from me? Why
suffered me to waste his time, instead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span>
of hastening to Lady Ellinor? How,
if Mr Trevanion's <i>sudden</i> illness had
brought the man to London&mdash;how
had he known so long beforehand (as
he himself told me, and his appointment
with the waiting woman proved)
the day he should arrive? Why now,
if there were no design of which Miss
Trevanion was the object&mdash;why so
frustrate the provident foresight of
her mother, and take advantage of
the natural yearning of affection, the
quick impulse of youth, to hurry off
a girl whose very station forbade her
to take such a journey without suitable
protection&mdash;against what must be
the wish, and what clearly were the
instructions, of Lady Ellinor? Alone,&mdash;worse
than alone! Fanny Trevanion
was then in the hands of two
servants, who were the instruments
and confidants of an adventurer like
Vivian; and that conference between
those servants&mdash;those broken references
to the morrow, coupled with the
name Vivian had assumed&mdash;needed
the unerring instincts of love more
cause for terror&mdash;terror the darker,
because the exact shape it should
assume was obscure and indistinct?</p>

<p>I sprang from the house.</p>

<p>I hastened into the Haymarket,
summoned a cabriolet, drove home as
fast as I could (for I had no money
about me for the journey I meditated;)
sent the servant of the lodging
to engage a chaise-and-four,
rushed into the room, where Roland
fortunately still was, and exclaimed&mdash;"Uncle,
come with me!&mdash;take money,
plenty of money!&mdash;Some villany I
know, though I cannot explain it, has
been practised on the Trevanions.
We may defeat it yet. I will tell
you all by the way&mdash;come, come!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But villany!&mdash;and
to people of such a station&mdash;pooh&mdash;collect
yourself. Who is the villain?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the man I have loved as a
friend&mdash;the man whom I myself
helped to make known to Trevanion.&mdash;Vivian&mdash;Vivian!"</p>

<p>"Vivian!&mdash;ah, the youth I have
heard you speak of. But how?&mdash;villany
to whom&mdash;to Trevanion?"</p>

<p>"You torture me with your questions.
Listen&mdash;this Vivian (I know
him)&mdash;he has introduced into the
house, as a servant, an agent capable
of any trick and fraud; that servant
has aided him to win over her maid&mdash;Fanny's&mdash;Miss
Trevanion's. Miss
Trevanion is an heiress, Vivian an
adventurer. My head swims round,
I cannot explain now. Ha! I will
write a line to Lord Castleton&mdash;tell
him my fears and suspicions&mdash;he will
follow us, I know, or do what is
best."</p>

<p>I drew ink and paper towards me,
and wrote hastily. My uncle came
round and looked over my shoulder.</p>

<p>Suddenly he exclaimed, seizing my
arm, "Gower, Gower. What name
is this? You said 'Vivian.'"</p>

<p>"Vivian or Gower&mdash;the same person."</p>

<p>My uncle hurried out of the
room. It was natural that he should
leave me to make our joint and brief
preparations for departure.</p>

<p>I finished my letter, sealed it, and
when, five minutes afterwards, the
chaise came to the door, I gave it to
the ostler who accompanied the horses,
with injunctions to deliver it forthwith
to Lord Castleton himself.</p>

<p>My uncle now descended, and
walked from the threshold with a
firm stride. "Comfort yourself," he
said, as he entered the chaise, into
which I had already thrown myself.
"We may be mistaken yet."</p>

<p>"Mistaken! You do not know this
young man. He has every quality that
could entangle a girl like Fanny, and
not, I fear, one sentiment of honour
that would stand in the way of his
ambition. I judge him now as by
a revelation&mdash;too late&mdash;oh Heavens, if
it be too late!"</p>

<p>A groan broke from Roland's lips.
I heard in it a proof of his sympathy
with my emotion, and grasped his
hand; it was as cold as the hand of
the dead.

<h2 id="THE_ROMANCE_OF_RUSSIAN_HISTORY4">THE ROMANCE OF RUSSIAN HISTORY.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></h2>

<p>Professor Shaw, in the preface to
his translation of Lajetchnikoff's striking
and interesting romance, <i>The Heretic</i>,
notices the shyness of English novelists
in approaching Russian ground.
"How happens it," he says, "that
Russia, with her reminiscences of two
centuries and a half of Tartar dominion&mdash;of
her long and bloody struggles
with the Ottoman and the Pole, whose
territories stretch almost from the
arctic ice to the equator, and whose
semi-oriental diadem bears inscribed
upon it such names as Peter and
Catherine&mdash;should have been passed
over as incapable of supplying rich
materials for fiction and romance?"
The question is hard to answer, and
appears doubly so after reading the
third volume of Monsieur A. Blanc's
recent work on political conspiracies
and executions,&mdash;a volume sufficient
of itself to set those romance-writing
who never wrote romance before. It
is a trite remark, that romances, having
history for their groundwork, derive
their attraction and interest far more
from the skill and genius of their
authors than from the importance of
the period selected, and from the historical
prominence of the characters
introduced. It is unnecessary to
name writers in whose hands a
Bayard or a du Guesclin, a Cromwell
or a Charles of Sweden, would appear
tame and commonplace. Our
readers need not to be reminded of
others of a different stamp,&mdash;and of one,
great amongst all, the rays of whose
genius have formed a halo of grandeur,
glory, or fascination around persons
to whom history accords scarcely
a word. But such genius is not of
every-day growth; and to historical
romance-writers of the calibre of most
of those with whom the British public
is now fain to cry content, the
mere devising of a plot, uniting tolerable
historical fidelity with some
claim to originality, is an undertaking
in which they are by no means uniformly
successful. To such we recommend,
as useful auxiliaries, M.
Blanc's octavos, and especially the
one that suggests the present article.
English and Scottish histories, if not
used up, have at least been very
handsomely worked, and have fairly
earned a little tranquillity upon their
shelves: the wars of the Stuarts, in
particular, have contributed more
than their quota to the literary fund.
The same may be said of the history
of France, so fertile in striking events,
and so largely made use of by purveyors
to the circulating libraries. Italy
and Spain, and even Poland, have
not escaped; whilst the East has been
disported over in every direction by
the accomplished Morier, and a swarm
of imitators and inferiors. But what
Englishman has tried his hand at a
Russian historical romance? We
strive in vain to call to mind an original
novel in our language founded on
incidents of Russian history&mdash;although
the history of scarcely any nation in
the world includes, in the same space
of time, a greater number of strange
and extraordinary events.</p>

<p>M. Blanc's book, notwithstanding
a certain air of pretension in the style
of its getting up, in the very mediocre
illustrations, and in the tone of the
introductory pages, is substantially
an unassuming performance. It is a
compilation, and contains little that
is not to be found printed elsewhere.
At the same time, perhaps in no other
work are the same events and details
thrown together in so compact and
entertaining a form. The author
troubles us with few comments of his
own, and his reserve in this respect
enhances the merit of his book, for
when he departs from it his views are
somewhat strained and ultra-French.
But his narrative is spiritedly put
together; and although it will be
found, upon comparison, that he has,
for the most part, faithfully adhered
to high historical authorities, to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span>
exclusion of mere traditionary matter
and of imaginative embellishment, yet
the dramatic interest of the subject is
itself so vivid, that the book reads
like a romance.</p>

<p>The Russian history, even to our
own day, is a sanguinary and cruel
chronicle. Its brevity is its best excuse.
The youth of the country extenuates
the crimes of its children.
For if the strides of Russia have been
vast and rapid in the paths of civilisation,
we must bear in mind that it
is but very recently the progress began.
"At the commencement of the
eighteenth century," says M. Blanc,
"it had certainly been very difficult to
foresee that fifty years later a magnificent
and polite court would be established
on the Gulf of Finland;
that soldiers raised on the banks of
the Volga and the Don would rank
with the best disciplined troops; and
that an empire, of itself larger than
all the rest of Europe, would have
passed from a state of barbarism to
one of civilisation as advanced as
that of the most favoured European
states." This is overshooting the
mark, and is an exaggeration even a
hundred years after the date assigned.
If the civilisation of St Petersburg
has for some time vied with that of
London or Paris, Russia, as a country,
has even now much to do before she
can be placed on a footing with England
or France in refinement and
intellectual cultivation. It is difficult
to institute a comparison in a case
where the nature of the countries, the
characters of the nations, and the
circumstances of their rise, are, and
have been, so dissimilar. The investigation
might easily entail a disquisition
of a length that would leave
very little room for an examination
of the book in hand. And all that
we seek in the present instance to
establish will be readily conceded&mdash;namely,
that in the throes of a country
accomplishing with unprecedented rapidity
the passage, usually so gradual,
from barbarism to civilisation, some
palliation is to be found for the faults
and vices of her nobles and rulers,
and for the blood-stains disfiguring
her annals.</p>

<p>The early history of Russia, from
the foundation of the empire by
Rurik to the reign of Ivan IV.&mdash;that is
to say from the middle of the ninth to
the middle of the sixteenth century&mdash;is
a chaos of traditions and uncertainties,
which M. Blanc has deemed unfavourable
to the project of his book,
and which he accordingly passes over
in an introductory chapter. His business,
as may be gathered from his
title-page, is with the internal convulsions
of the country; and these
are difficult to trace, until Ivan Vassilivitch
threw off the Tartar yoke,
and his grandson Ivan IV., surnamed
the Tyrant, or the Terrible, began,
with an iron hand, it is true, to
labour at the regeneration of his
country. A bloodthirsty despot,
Russia yet owes him much. The
people, demoralised by Tartar rule,
needed rigid laws and severe treatment.
Ivan promulgated a code far
superior to any previously in use.
He invited to Russia foreign mechanics,
artists, and men of science;
established the first printing-press
seen in the country; and laid the
foundation of Russian trade, by a
treaty of commerce with our own
Elizabeth. By the conquest of Kazan,
of the kingdom of Astracan, and of
districts adjacent to the Caucasus, he
extended the limits of the Russian
empire. But his wise enactments
and warlike successes were sullied by
atrocious acts of cruelty. In Novogorod,
which had offended him by its
desires for increased liberty, he raged
for six weeks like an incensed tiger.
Sixty thousand human beings, according
to some historians, fell victims on
that occasion. Similar scenes of
butchery were enacted in Tver, Moscow,
and other cities. His cruel disposition
was evident at a very early
age. He was but thirteen years old
when he assembled his boyarins to
inform them that he needed not their
guidance, and would no longer submit
to their encroachments on his royal
prerogative. "I ought to punish you
all," he said, "for all of you have
been guilty of offences against my
person; but I will be indulgent, and
the weight of my anger shall fall only
on Andrew Schusky, who is the worst
amongst you." Schusky, the head of
a family which had seized the reins
of government during the Czar's minority,
endeavoured to justify himself.
Ivan would not hear him. "Seize and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">666</span>
bind him," cried the boy-despot,
"and throw him to my dogs. They
have a right to the repast." A pack
of ferocious hounds, which Ivan took
pleasure in rearing, were brought
under the window, and irritated by
every possible means. When they
were sufficiently exasperated, Andrew
Schusky was thrown amongst them.
His cries increased their fury, and
his body was torn to shreds and devoured.</p>

<p>Ivan dead, his son Feodor, who
should have been surnamed the Feeble,
as his father was the Terrible, ascended
the Russian throne. He was
the last of Rurik's descendants who
occupied it. Even during his reign
he recognised as regent of the empire
his brother-in-law, the insolent and
ambitious Boris Godunof. Possessed
of the real power, this man coveted
the external pomp of royalty. The
crown was his aim, and to its possession
after the death of Feodor, who,
as weak of body as of mind, was not
likely to be long-lived, only one obstacle
existed. This was a younger
son of Ivan IV., a child of a few years
old, named Dmitri or Demetrius.
The existence of this infant was a
slight bar to one so unscrupulous as
Godunof, a bar which a poniard soon
removed. Feodor died, and his brother-in-law
accepted, with much show
of reluctance, the throne he had so
long desired to fill. For the first
time for many years he breathed
freely; his end was attained; he
thought not of the many crimes that
had led to it, of the spilt blood of his
child-victim, or of that of two hundred
of the inhabitants of Ouglitch,
judicially murdered by his orders in
revenge of the death of Demetrius'
assassins, whom the people had risen
upon and slain; the tears of Ivan's
widow, now childless and confined in
a convent, and of her whole family,
condemned to a horrible captivity,
troubled not his repose or his dreams
of future prosperity. But whilst he
exulted in security and splendour, his
joy was suddenly troubled by a strange
retribution. Demetrius was dead; of
that there could be no doubt; his emissary's
dagger had done the work too
surely&mdash;but the name of the rightful
heir survived to make the usurper
tremble. It is curious to observe in
how many details Godunof's own
crimes contributed to his punishment.
His man&oelig;uvres to suppress the facts
of Demetrius' death, by stopping
couriers and falsifying despatches, so
as to make it appear that the young
prince had killed himself with a knife
in a fit of epilepsy, had thrown a sort
of mystery and ambiguity over the
whole transaction, favourable to the
designs and pretensions of impostors.
One of the many dark deeds by which
he had paved his way to the supreme
power was the removal of the metropolitan
of the Russian church, who
was deposed and shut up in a convent,
where it was pretty generally believed
he met a violent death. In lieu of
this dignitary, previously the sole
chief of the Russian church, Godunof
created a patriarchate, and Jeremiah
of Constantinople went to Moscow to
install the first patriarch, whose name
was Job. This prelate, whilst visiting
the convent of Tchudof, was struck
by the intelligence of a young monk
named Gregory Otrepief or Atrepief,
who could read, then a rare accomplishment,
and who showed great readiness
of wit. The patriarch took this
youth into his service as secretary,
and often carried him with him when
he went to visit the Czar. Dazzled
by the brilliancy of the court, and
perceiving the ignorance and incapacity
of many high personages, Otrepief
conceived the audacious design of
elevating himself above those to whom
he felt himself already far superior in
ability. He was acquainted with the
details of the death of young Demetrius;
and from some old servants of the
Czarina Mary he obtained particulars
of the character, qualities, and tastes
of the deceased prince, all of which
he carefully noted down, as well as
the names and titles of the officers and
attendants who had been attached to
his person. Having prepared and
studied his part, he asked leave to
return to his convent. This was
granted. His fellow-monks wondered
to see him thus abandon the advantageous
prospects held out to him by
the favour of the patriarch.</p>

<p>"What should I become by remaining
at court?" replied Otrepief, with
a laugh: "a bishop at most, and
I mean to be Czar of Moscow."</p>

<p>At first this passed as a joke; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span>
Otrepief, either through bravado, or
because it formed part of his scheme,
repeated it so often, that it at last
came to the ears of the Czar himself,
who said the monk must be mad. At
the same time, as he knew by experience
that the usurpation of the throne
was not an impossible thing, he ordered,
as an excessive precaution, that
the boaster should be sent to a remote
convent. Otrepief set out, but on the
road he seduced his escort, consisting
of two monks. By large promises he
prevailed with them to accompany
him to Lithuania, where many enemies
of Godunof had taken refuge. According
to the custom of the times,
the travellers passed the nights in
roadside monasteries, and in every cell
that he occupied Otrepief wrote upon
the walls&mdash;"I am Demetrius, son of
Ivan IV. Although believed to be
dead, I escaped from my assassins.
When I am upon my father's throne
I will recompense the generous men
who now show me hospitality." Soon
the report spread far and wide that
the Czarowitz Demetrius lived, and
had arrived in Lithuania. Otrepief
assumed a layman's dress, left his
monkish adherents&mdash;one of whom
agreed to bear the name his leader
now renounced&mdash;and presented himself
as the son of Ivan IV. to the
Zaporian Cossacks, amongst whom he
soon acquired the military habits and
knowledge which he deemed essential
to the success of his daring schemes.
After a campaign or two, which, judging
from the character of his new
associates, were probably mere brigand-like
expeditions in quest of pillage,
Otrepief resumed the cowl, and
entered the service of a powerful
noble named Vichnevetski, whom he
knew to have been greatly attached to
Ivan IV. Pretending to be dangerously
ill, he asked for a confessor.
After receiving absolution: "I am
about to die," he said to the priest;
"and I entreat you, holy father, to
have me buried with the honours due
to the son of the Czar." The priest,
a Jesuit, (the Jesuits were then all-powerful
in Poland) asked the meaning
of these strange words, which
Otrepief declined telling, but said they
would be explained after his death by
a letter beneath his pillow. This
letter the astonished Jesuit took an
opportunity to purloin, and at the
same time he perceived on the sick
man's breast a gold cross studded with
diamonds&mdash;a present received by
Otrepief when secretary to the patriarch.
In all haste the Jesuit went to
Vichnevetski; they opened the letter,
and gathered from its contents that
he who had presented himself to them
as a poor monk was no other than
Demetrius, son of Ivan IV. Vichnevetski
had in his service two Russians
who had been soldiers of Ivan.
Led to the sick man's bedside, these
declared that they perfectly recognised
in him the Czarowitz Demetrius;
first, by his features&mdash;although they
had not seen him since his childhood&mdash;and
afterwards by two warts upon
his face, and by an inequality in the
length of his arms.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, never negligent of opportunities
to increase their power,
saw in the pretender to the czardom
a fit instrument for the propagation
of Romanism in Russia. They enlisted
Sigismund king of Poland in
the cause of the false Demetrius, who
was treated as a prince, and lodged in
a palace. Thence he negotiated with
the pope's nuncio, who gave him assurance
of the support of all Catholic
Europe in exchange for his promise to
unite Russia to the Latin church. An
army of Poles and Russian refugees
was raised, and the southern provinces
of Russia were inundated with florid
proclamations, in which the joys of an
earthly paradise were offered to all
who espoused the cause of their legitimate
sovereign, Demetrius. The
Don Cossacks, whose robberies had
been recently checked by Godunof,
flocked to the pretender's banner, and
so formidable was the army thus collected,
that the Czar began heartily
to regret having paid such small attention
to the words of the monk
Otrepief. The Ukraine declared for
the self-styled son of Ivan IV.; the
voevóda of Sandomir, whose daughter
he had promised to marry, acknowledged
him as his prince; towns
submitted, and fortresses opened their
gates to the impostor, now in full
march upon Moscow. Blinded by
success, Otrepief fancied himself invincible;
and, with scarcely fifteen thousand
soldiers, he hurried to meet the
Muscovite army, fifty thousand strong,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span>
and provided with a formidable artillery.
Beaten, his undisciplined forces
dispersed, and he himself escaped
death by a miracle; but his courage
was still undaunted. After a few
days, during which he slept upon the
snow, and subsisted upon a few grains
of barley, he succeeded in rallying his
scattered bands. These became the
nucleus of a new army; and at the
very moment that Godunof, rejoicing
at his victory, prepared to chastise
the nobles compromised in the rebellion,
he heard that his enemy was
again afoot, more formidable than
ever. Furious at the news, the Czar
addressed reproaches and menaces to
his generals, whom he thus completely
alienated; and thenceforth he was
surrounded by enemies. A sudden
illness soon afterwards carried him
off, giving him scarcely time to proclaim
his son Feodor his successor.
Court and clergy, people and army,
paid homage to the young Czar.
Amongst others, the general-in-chief
of the army took the oath of fidelity;
but no sooner was he again at the
head of his troops, than he negotiated
with Otrepief, and went over to him
with all his forces. A few days afterwards
the pretender was in Moscow.
He strangled Feodor, and proclaimed
himself Czar. Never had an impostor
played his part with greater skill and
such complete success. He had the
art even to obtain his recognition
from Ivan's widow. He recalled her
relations, exiled since Godunof's usurpation,
restored them their property
and loaded them with honours, and
then sent word to Mary that he would
be to her a good son or a severe master,
as she chose. The Czarina acknowledged
him as her son, and was
present at his coronation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the strength of
this evidence, a noble, named Basil
Shusky or Zulski,&mdash;of the family
whose chief Ivan IV. had thrown to his
hounds,&mdash;still contended against the
usurper. He had himself seen the
corpse of Ivan's son Demetrius, and
he declared as much to his friends and
partisans, whom he offered to head
and lead against the impostor. Before
his plans were ripe, however, he
was arrested and brought to trial.
Otrepief offered to pardon him if he
would name his accomplices, and
publicly admit that he had lied in
stating that he had seen the dead
body of the son of Ivan IV.</p>

<p>"I will retract nothing," was
Shusky's firm reply; "for I have
spoken the truth: the man who now
wears the crown of the Czar is a vile
impostor. I know the fate reserved
for me; but those you uselessly urge
me to betray will revenge my death,
and the usurper shall fall."</p>

<p>As he persisted in his courageous
assertions, the judges ordered him to
be put to the torture. The executioner
tied his hands behind him
and placed upon his head an iron
crown, bristling internally with sharp
points; then, with the palm of his
hand, he struck the top of the
crown, and blood streamed over the
victim's face.</p>

<p>"Confess your guilt!" said the
judge.</p>

<p>The intrepid Shusky repeated his
asseveration of Otrepief's imposture.
The judge signed to the executioner,
who again clapped a heavy hand upon
the iron diadem. But suffering only
augmented the energy of the heroic
Muscovite, who continued, as long as
consciousness remained in his tortured
head, to denounce the false Czar. At
last, when the whole of the forehead
and the greater part of the skull were
bared to the bone, he fainted and was
removed. The terrible crown had
been pressed down to his eyes. He was
condemned to decapitation; but Otrepief
pardoned him upon the scaffold,
and, sometime afterwards, was imprudent
enough to take him into favour and
make him his privy counsellor. Shusky
had vowed revenge, and waited only
for an opportunity. This was accelerated
by Otrepief's fancied security.
One morning the false Demetrius was
roused by alarm-bells, and, on looking
from a window, he beheld the palace
surrounded by a host of armed conspirators.
The doors were speedily
forced; pursued from room to room
by overwhelming numbers, his clothes
and the doors through which he fled
riddled with balls, the Czar at last
leaped from a window, and, notwithstanding
serious injuries received in
falling, he reached a guardhouse occupied
by the Strelitz. The post was
soon surrounded by an armed and
menacing crowd; but the officer commanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span>
declared he would defend his
sovereign with his life.</p>

<p>"He whom you call your sovereign
is a monk who has usurped the
crown," said Shusky to the officer.</p>

<p>"He is the son of the Czarina Mary,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"The Czarina herself declares him
an impostor."</p>

<p>"Show me her written declaration
to that effect, and I will give him up;
but only on that condition."</p>

<p>Shusky ran to the convent where
Mary lived in a kind of semi-captivity,
told her what was passing,&mdash;that the
capital was in his power, and that she
could not now refuse to proclaim the
imposture of the wretch who had compelled
her to recognise him as her son.
Mary yielded the more easily that her
timorous conscience reproached her
with the falsehood by which she had
confirmed an adventurer in the imperial
dignity; she signed and sealed
the declaration demanded, and Shusky
hastened with it to the officer of Strelitz.
Otrepief was given up. Shusky
assembled some boyarins and formed
a tribunal, of which he himself was
president, and before which the Czar,
thus rapidly cast down from the
throne to which his address and
courage had elevated him, was forthwith
arraigned.</p>

<p>"The hour of expiation is come,"
said Shusky. "The head you so barbarously
mutilated has never ceased
to ponder vengeance. Monk Otrepief,
confess yourself an impostor, that
God, before whom you are about to
appear, may have pity on your soul."</p>

<p>"I am the Czar Demetrius," replied
Otrepief, with much assurance: "it is
not the first time that rebellious subjects,
led astray by traitors, have
dared lay hands on the sacred person
of their sovereign; but such crimes
never remain unpunished."</p>

<p>"You would gain time," replied
Shusky; "but you will not succeed;
the Czarina Mary's declaration is sufficient
for us to decide upon your fate,
and, so doing, we doom you to die."</p>

<p>Thereupon four men seized the culprit
and pushed him against a wall;
two others, armed with muskets,
went close up to him and shot him.
He struggled an instant, and then expired.
His corpse, dragged by the
mob to the place of common execution,
was there abandoned with outrage
and mutilation. His death was
the signal for the massacre of the
Poles, whom Otrepief had always favoured,
affecting their manners, and
selecting them for his body-guard.
Moscow just then contained a great
number of those foreigners; for Marina,
daughter of the voevóda of Sandomir,
had arrived a few days before
for her nuptials with the Czar, and
had been closely followed by the King
of Poland's ambassadors, with an
armed and numerous suite. After an
orgie at the palace, the Poles had
committed various excesses, beating
peaceable citizens and outraging
women, which had greatly exasperated
the people. Besides this, their religion
rendered them odious; and scarcely
had the false Demetrius fallen when
the Russian priests and monks raised
the cry of massacre. With shouts of
"Down with the Pope!" and "Death
to the heretics!" they spread through
the city, pointing out to the people
the dwellings of the Poles, whose doors
were already marked by the conspirators.
It was a St Bartholomew on a
small scale. Blood flowed for six
hours in the streets of Moscow: more
than a thousand Poles were slaughtered;
and, when the work was done,
the murderers repaired to the churches
to thank God for the success of their
enterprise. Shusky was proclaimed
Czar by the will of the people, which,
at that moment, it would not have
been safe to thwart.</p>

<p>The brilliant success of one impostor,
temporary though it had
proved, soon raised up others. Shusky
was no sooner on the throne than
the report spread that Czar Demetrius
had not been shot&mdash;that a faithful adherent
had suffered death in his stead.
And a runaway serf, Ivan Bolotnikof by
name, undertook to personate the defunct
impostor. But although he collected
a sort of army of Strelitz,
Cossacks, and peasants, glad of any
pretext for pillage, and although he
was recognised by two powerful
princes, one of whom, strange to say,
was his former owner, Prince Téliatevski,
his abilities and his success
were alike far inferior to those of
Otrepief. Astracan and several other
towns revolted in his favour; but
Shusky marched against him, won a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">670</span>
battle, in which Téliatevski was killed,
and besieged Toula, in which Bolotnikof
and the other chiefs of the revolt
had shut themselves up. "The besieged,"
says M. Blanc, "defended
themselves vigorously"; but Shusky,
by the advice of a child, who was
assuredly born with the genius of destruction,
stopped the course of the
Oupa, by means of a dike made
below the town, through which the
river flowed. The topographical
position of the town was such that in
a few hours it was completely under
water. Many of the inhabitants were
drowned; defence became impossible;
and Bolotnikof, seized by his mutinous
followers, was given up to
Shusky. This second false Demetrius
was forthwith shot; but his fate did not
discourage a third impostor, who, like
his predecessor, commanded armies, but
never reached the throne. From first
to last, no less than seven candidates
appeared for the name and birthright
of Ivan's murdered son. Three of them
were promptly crushed; the seventh
audaciously asserted that he united in
his person not only the true Demetrius,
whom Godunof had assassinated, but
also the one whom Shusky had dragged
from the throne, and two of the subsequent
impostors. This was rather
a strong dose even for Cossacks to
swallow; but these gentlemen rejoiced
at the prospect of booty, affected to
credit the tale, and bore the pretender's
banner to within a short distance
of Moscow. There his career terminated.
A Cossack chief, who had often
seen Otrepief, finding himself in the
presence of the seventh Demetrius, declared
aloud that he was not the Czar
he had served, arrested the impostor
with his own hand, and hung him on
a neighbouring tree.</p>

<p>The annals of this period of Russian
history are painful from the atrocities
they record; and M. Blanc is prodigal
of horrors. The interval of a
quarter of a century between the extinction
of the line of Rurik and the
accession of the Romanoff dynasty, still
paramount in Russia, was occupied by
constant struggles between usurpers
and pretenders, none of whom dreamed
of a milder fate than death for the
foe who fell into their hands. And
happy was the vanquished chief who
escaped with a prompt and merciful
death by axe or bullet. The most
hideous tortures were put in practice,
either for the extortion of confessions,
or for the gratification of malice. Even
Shusky, whom we have shown enduring
with noble fortitude the agonising
pressure of the iron crown, learned not
mercy from suffering. His treatment
of an enthusiastic boyarin, sent by
the third false Demetrius to summon
him to vacate the throne, was such as
Red Indians or Spanish inquisitors
might have shuddered to witness. It
is recorded, in all its horrible details,
at page 52 of the <i>Histoire des Conspirations</i>,
&amp;c. The torture of individuals,
which was of frequent occurrence,
was varied from time to time
by the massacre of multitudes. We
have mentioned that of the Poles. In
1611, after Shusky's dethronement, it
was the turn of the Muscovites. The
Poles having seized Moscow, insisted
that Vladislaus, son of the King of
Poland, should be elected Czar. The
nobles consented, but the patriarch
steadily refused his consent; and, by
the law of the land, his opposition
nullified the election. Thereupon the
Poles ran riot in the city, plundering,
murdering, and ravishing; and at
last, unsheathing the sword for a general
slaughter, twenty thousand men,
women, and children fell in one day
beneath the murderous steel. A Muscovite
army then closely blockaded
the place: and the Poles were reduced
to the greatest extremity of famine.
They at last surrendered on condition
of their lives being spared, notwithstanding
which compact many were
massacred by the Cossacks.  "And
yet," says M. Blanc, "the aspect of
the town was well calculated to excite
compassion rather than hatred. In
the streets the cadaverous and emaciated
inhabitants looked like spectres;
in the houses were the remains
of unclean animals, fragments of repasts
horrible to imagine; and what
is still more frightful, perhaps unprecedented,
salting tubs were found,
<i>filled with human flesh</i>."</p>

<p>It was under the reign of Alexis,
the second Romanoff and father of
Peter the Great, that there appeared
in Russia the most extraordinary
robber the world ever saw. He claimed
not to be a Czar or the son of a Czar;
the Demetrius mask was out of date,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span>
and one real and another pretended
son of Otrepief and Marina had
been executed by order of Alexis. The
new adventurer was a common Cossack
from the Don, who went by his
own name of Stenka Razin, and to
whom M. Blanc attributes, perhaps
with a little exaggeration, the ambition,
courage, and ferocity of a Tamerlane.
In those days the Russian
territory was by no means free from
robbers, who pillaged caravans of
merchandise, but generally respected
the property of the Czar and the principal
nobles, lest they should make
themselves powerful enemies. Razin's
first act was to throw down the glove
to his sovereign. He seized a convoy
belonging to the court, and hung
some gentlemen who endeavoured to
defend it. The fame of his intrepidity
and success brought him many followers,
and soon he was at the head
of an army. "He embarked on the
Caspian Sea, and cruised along its
shores, frequently landing and seizing
immense booty. At the mouth of the
Yaik he was met by an officer of the
Czar's, sent by the voevóda of Astracan
to offer him and his companions
a free pardon on condition of
their discontinuing their robberies.
Razin replied that he was no robber,
but a conqueror; that he made war,
and suffered none to fail in respect
towards him. And to prove his words,
he hung the officer, and drowned the
men of his escort. A numerous body
of Strelitz was then sent against him.
Razin beat the Strelitz, seized the
town of Yatskoi, massacred the garrison
and the inhabitants, and passed
the winter there unmolested. In the
spring he marched into Persia."
There he accumulated immense booty,
but was at last expelled by a general
rising of the population. On his return
to Russia he was soon surrounded
by troops; but even then, such was
the terror of his name, the Russian
general granted him a capitulation,
by which he and his men were
permitted to retire to their native
provinces, taking their plunder with
them; and their security was guaranteed
so long as they abstained from
aggression. This scandalous convention
was ratified by Alexis, but was
not long adhered to by the bandit
with whom the Czar thus meanly
condescended to treat as an equal.
Stenka's next campaign was even
more successful than the previous one.
Bodies of troops deserted to him, and
several towns fell into his power;
amongst others, that of Astracan,
where frightful scenes of violence and
murder were enacted&mdash;Razin himself
parading the streets, intoxicated with
brandy, and stabbing all he met. He
was marching upon Moscow, with the
avowed intention of dethroning the
Czar, when he sustained a reverse,
and, after fighting like a lion, was
made prisoner, and sent in fetters to
the city he had expected to enter in
triumph. Taken before Alexis, he
replied boldly and haughtily to the
Czar's reproaches and threats. The
only anxiety he showed was to know
what manner of death he was to suffer.
He had heard that, in the previous
year, an obscure robber and assassin,
who pillaged convents and churches,
had been cut into pieces of half a
finger's breadth, beginning at the toes.
This barbarous punishment, of which
several instances are cited in M.
Blanc's book, was known as the "torture
of the ten thousand pieces." "But,"
exclaimed Stenka Razin, with a sort
of terror, so horrible did this death
appear to him, "I am no robber of
monks! I have commanded armies.
I have made peace with the Czar,
therefore I had a right to make war
upon him. Is there not a man
amongst you brave enough to split
my head with a hatchet?"  The Strelitz
guards, to whom these words
were addressed, refused the friendly
office, and Razin heard himself condemned
to be quartered alive. He
seemed resigned, as if he considered
this death an endurable medium between
the decapitation he had implored
of his judges and the barbarous
mincing he had been led to expect.
But his energy forsook him on the
scaffold, and the man who had so
often confronted and inflicted death,
received it in a swooning state.</p>

<p>The characters of few sovereigns
admit of being judged more variously
than that of Peter I. of Russia, surnamed
the Great. According to the
point of view whence we contemplate
him, we behold the hero or the savage;
the wise legislator or the lawless tyrant;
the patient pursuer of science
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span>
or the dissolute and heartless debauchee.
In the long chapter given
to his romantic and eventful reign, M.
Blanc shows him little favour. In a
work treating of conspiracies and executions,
the characters of the sovereigns
introduced are naturally not
exhibited under their most amiable
aspect, especially when those sovereigns
are Russian czars and czarinas,
to whom lenity has generally been
less familiar than severity, and pardon
than punishment. The pen of Voltaire
has done much for the reputation
of Peter the Great, who to us has
always appeared an overrated personage.
Historians have vaunted his
exploits and good deeds, till his crimes
and barbarities have been lost sight
of in the glitter of panegyric. The
monarch who could debase himself to
the level of an executioner, beheading
his rebel subjects with his own hand,
and feasting his eyes with the spectacle
of death when he himself was
weary of slaying; who could condemn
his wife, repudiated without cause, to
the frightful torture of the knout, and
sign the order, which it is more than
suspected he himself executed, for the
death of his own son&mdash;may have been
great as a warrior and a legislator,
but must ever be execrated as a man.
Peter was certainly an extraordinary
compound of vices and virtues. His
domestic life will not bear even the
most superficial investigation, and M.
Blanc has ripped it up unmercifully.
The great reformer&mdash;we might almost
say the founder&mdash;of the mighty empire
of Russia, the conqueror of
Charles of Sweden, was a drunkard
and gross sensualist, a bad father, a
cruel and unfaithful husband. Indeed
some of his acts seem inexplicable
otherwise than by that ferocious insanity
manifest in more than one of his
descendants. Even his rare impulses
of mercy were apt to come too late to
save the victim. As illustrating one
of them, an incident, nearly the last
event of Peter's life, is given by M.
Blanc, in more minute detail than we
ever before met with it. Peter's
whole life was a romance; but this
is assuredly one of its most romantic
episodes. A short time before his
death, according to M. Blanc, although
other writers fix the date some years
earlier, Peter was violently smitten by
the charms of a young girl named
Ivanowa. Although tenderly attached,
and about to be married to an
officer of the regiment of Schouvaloff,
she dared not oppose the Czar's
wishes, but became his mistress.
Peter, who took her repugnance for
timidity, fancied himself beloved, and
passed much of his time in her society,
in a charming cottage in which he had
installed her at one of the extremities
of St Petersburg. He had enriched
her family, who were ignorant, however,
of her retreat. Her betrothed,
whose name was Demetrius Daniloff,
was in despair at her disappearance,
and made unceasing efforts to discover
her, but all in vain, until Ivanowa,
having made a confidant of a Livonian
slave, had him conducted to her presence.
The lovers' meetings were
then frequent, so much so, that Peter
received intelligence of them.  "His
anger was terrible; he roared like a
tiger.</p>

<p>'Betrayed! betrayed everywhere
and always!' cried he, striding wildly
about the room, and striking his brow
with his clenched fist. 'Oh! revenge!
revenge!'</p>

<p>Before the close of day he left
the palace, alone, wrapped in a coarse
cloak, his feet in nailed shoes whose
patches attested their long services,
his head covered with a fox-skin cap
which came down over his eyebrows
and half concealed his eyes. He
soon reached Ivanowa's house, where
the lovers deemed themselves perfectly
secure, for the Czar had spread
a report of his departure for Moscow.
Moreover, the faithful Livonian slave
kept watch in the antechamber, to
give an alarm at the least noise.
Peter knew all this, and had taken
his measures accordingly. Opening
an outer door with a key of
his own, he bounded into the anteroom,
upset the slave, and, with a
kick of his powerful foot, burst the
door that separated him from the
lovers. All this occurred with the
speed of lightning. Daniloff and
Ivanowa had scarce time to rise from
their seats, before the Czar stood over
them with his drawn sword in his
hand. Ivanowa uttered a cry of
terror, fell on her knees, and fainted.
Prompt as the Czar, Daniloff bared
his sabre and threw himself between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">673</span>
his mistress and Peter. The latter
lowered his weapon.</p>

<p>'No,' he said, 'the revenge were
too brief.'</p>

<p>He opened a window and cried
<i>hourra</i>! At the signal, a hundred
soldiers crowded into the house.
Mastering his fury, the Czar ordered
the young officer to be taken to
prison, there to receive one hundred
blows of the <i>battogues</i> or sticks.
Ivanowa was also confined until the
senate should decide on her fate.
The next day Daniloff received his
terrible punishment. Before half of
it had been inflicted, his back, from,
the loins to the shoulders, was one
hideous wound," &amp;c. &amp;c. We omit
the revolting details. "Nevertheless
the executioners continued to strike,
and the hundred blows were counted,
without a complaint from the sufferer.
The unfortunate Daniloff had not even
fainted; he got up alone,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> when untied,
and asked to have his wounds
carefully dressed.</p>

<p>'I have need to live a short time
longer,' he added."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ivanowa was brought
before the senate, and accused of
high treason and of trying to discover
state secrets&mdash;a charge of
Peter's invention. The supple senate,
created by the Czar, condemned her
to receive twenty-two blows of the
knout in the presence of her accomplice
Daniloff, already punished by
the emperor's order. On the day
appointed for the execution, Peter
stood upon the balcony of his winter
palace. Several battalions of infantry
marched past, escorting the unfortunate
Demetrius, who, in spite of the
frightful sufferings he still endured,
walked with a steady step, and with
a firm and even joyful countenance.
Surrounded by another escort, was
seen the young and lovely Ivanowa,
half dead with terror, supported on
one side by a priest and on the other
by a soldier, and letting her beautiful
head fall from one shoulder to the
other, according to the impulse given
it by her painful progress. Even
Peter's heart melted at the sight.
Re-entering his apartment, he put on
the ribbon of the order of St Andrew,
threw a cloak over his shoulders, left
the palace, sprang into a boat, and
reached the opposite side of the river
at the same time as the mournful
procession which had crossed the
bridge. Making his way through the
crowd, he dropped his cloak, took
Ivanowa in his arms, and imprinted
a kiss upon her brow. A murmur
arose amongst the people, and suddenly
cries of "pardon" were heard.</p>

<p>The knights of St Andrew then
enjoyed the singular privilege that a
kiss given by them to a condemned
person, deprived the executioner of
his victim. This privilege has endured
even to our day, but not without
some modification.</p>

<p>Daniloff had recognised Peter.
He approached the Czar, whose every
movement he had anxiously watched,
stripped off his coat, and rent the
bloody shirt that covered his shoulders.</p>

<p>"'The man who could suffer thus,'
he said, 'knows how to die. Czar,
thy repentance comes too late!
Ivanowa, I go to wait for thee!'
And drawing a concealed poniard,
he stabbed himself twice. His death
was instantaneous. Peter hurried
back to his palace, and the stupified,
crowd slowly dispersed. Ivanowa
died shortly afterwards in the convent
to which she had been permitted
to retire."</p>

<p>If we are frequently shocked, in the
course of M. Blanc's third volume, by
the tyrannical and brutal cruelty of
the Russian sovereigns, we are also
repeatedly disgusted by the servility
and patient meanness of those who
suffered from it. We behold Muscovite
nobles of high rank and descent,
cringing under the wanton torments
inflicted on them by their
oppressor, and submitting to degradations
to which death, one would
imagine, were, to any free-spirited
man, fifty times preferable. As an
example, we will cite the conduct
of a Prince Galitzin, who, after long
exile in Germany, where he had
become a convert to the Romish
church, solicited and obtained permission
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">674</span>
to return to his country.
This was in 1740, under the reign of
the dissolute and cruel Czarina Anne.
The paramours and flatterers who
composed the court of that licentious
princess, urged her to inflict on the
new-made papist the same punishment
that had been suffered by a
noble named Vonitzin, who had
turned Jew, and had been burned
alive, or rather roasted at a slow fire.
Anne refused, but promised the courtiers
they should not be deprived of
their sport.</p>

<p>"The same day, Galitzin, although
upwards of forty years old, was
ordered to take his place amongst the
pages: a few days later he received
a notification that the empress, contented
with his services, had been
pleased to raise him to the dignity of
her third buffoon. 'The custom of
buffoons,' says an historian, 'was
then in full force in Russia; the
empress had six, <i>three of whom were
of very high birth</i>, and when they
did not lend themselves with a good
grace to the tomfooleries required of
them by her or her favourites, she
had them punished with the <i>battogues</i>.'
The empress appeared well satisfied
with the manner in which the prince
fulfilled his new duties; and, as he
was a widower, she declared she
would find him a wife, that so valuable
a subject might not die without
posterity. They selected, for the
poor wretch's bride, the most hideous
and disgusting creature that could be
found in the lowest ranks of the
populace. Anne herself arranged the
ceremonial of the wedding. It was
in the depth of one of the severest
winters of the century; and, at great
expense, the empress had a palace
built of ice. Not only was the building
entirely constructed of that material,
but all the furniture, including
the nuptial bed, was also of ice. In
front of the palace were ice cannons,
mounted on ice carriages.</p>

<p>Anne and all her court conducted
the newly-married pair to this palace,
their destined habitation. The guests
were in sledges drawn by dogs and
reindeer; the husband and wife,
enclosed in a cage, were carried on
an elephant. When the procession
arrived near the palace, the ice
cannons were fired, and not one of
them burst, so intense was the cold.
Several of them were even loaded
with bullets, which pierced thick
planks at a considerable distance.
When everybody had entered the
singular edifice, the ball began. It
probably did not last long. On its
conclusion, Anne insisted on the bride
and bridegroom being put to bed in
her presence: they were undressed,
with the exception of their under
garments, and were compelled to lie
down upon the bed of ice, without
covering of any kind. Then the
company went away, and sentinels
were placed at the door of the nuptial
chamber, to prevent the couple from
leaving it before the next day!  But
when the next day came, they had to
be carried out; the poor creatures
were in a deplorable state, and survived
their torture but a few days."</p>

<p>This patient submission to a long
series of indignities on the part of
a man of Galitzin's rank and blood
is incomprehensible, and pity for his
cruel death is mingled with contempt
for the elderly prince who could
tamely play the page, and caper in
the garb of a court jester. But the
Russian noble of that day&mdash;and even
of a later period&mdash;united the soul of
a slave with the heart of a tyrant.
To the feeble a relentless tiger, before
the despot or the despot's favourite
he grovelled like a spiritless cur.
The memoirs of the eighteenth century
abound in examples of his base
servility. We cite one, out of many
which we find recorded in an interesting
<i>Life of Catherine II. of
Russia</i>, published at Paris in 1797.
Plato Zouboff, one of Catherine's
favourite lovers, had a little monkey,
a restless, troublesome beast, which
everybody detested, but which everybody
caressed, by way of paying court
to its master. Amongst the host of
ministers, military men, and ambassadors,
who sedulously attended the
levees of the powerful favourite, was
a general officer, remarkable for
the perfection and care with which
his hair was dressed. One day the
monkey climbed upon his head, and,
after completely destroying the symmetry
of his hyacinthine locks, deliberately
defiled them. The officer
dared not show the slightest discontent.
There are not wanting, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">675</span>
in the history of the eighteenth
century, instances of heroism and
courage to contrast with the far more
numerous ones of vileness afforded by
the aristocracy of Russia. The dignity
and fortitude of Menzikoff&mdash;that
pastrycook's boy who became a
great minister&mdash;during his terrible
exile in Siberia, are an oft-told tale.
Prince Dolgorouki, the same to whom
Anne owed her crown, and whom
she requited by a barbarous death,
beheld his son, brother, and nephew
broken on the wheel. When his
turn came, and the executioners were
arranging him suitably upon the instrument
of torture: "Do as you please
with me," he said, "and without fear
of loading your consciences, for it is
not in human power to increase my
sufferings." And he died without
uttering a complaint. But perhaps
the most extraordinary instance of
coolness and self command, at the
moment of a violent and cruel death,
to be found in the annals of executions,
is that of Pugatscheff, who,
however, was no nobleman, but a Cossack
of humble birth, who deserted
from the Russian army after the siege
and capture of Bender by General
Panim, and fled to Poland, where he
was concealed for a time by hermits
of the Greek church. "Conversing
one day with his protectors," says a
French writer already referred to,
"he told them, that once, during his
service in General Panim's army, a
Russian officer said to him, after staring
him very hard in the face, 'If
the emperor Peter III., my master,
were not dead, I should think I now
stood before him.' The hermits paid
little attention to this tale; but some
time afterwards one of their number,
who had not yet met Pugatscheff, exclaimed,
on beholding him, 'Is not
that the emperor, Peter III.?' The
monks then induced him to attempt
an imposture they had planned." M.
Blanc's account differs from this, inasmuch
as it asserts the resemblance
to the defunct Czar to have been very
slight. Whatever the degree of likeness,
Pugatscheff declared himself the
husband of Catherine II. (murdered
some time previously, by Prince Bariatinski
and by Alexis Orloff, the
brother of Catherine's lover), and
thousands credited his pretensions.
The Cossacks of the river Yaik (afterwards
changed to the Ural by Catherine,
who desired to obliterate the
memory of this revolt) were just then
in exceedingly bad humour. After
patiently submitting to a great deal
of oppression and ill usage, they had
received orders to cut off their beards.
This they would not do. They had
relinquished, grumbling but passive,
many a fair acre of pasturage; they
had furnished men for a new regiment
of hussars; but they rebelled outright
when ordered to use a razor. The
Livonian general, Traubenberg, repaired
to Yaitsk with a strong staff
of barbers, and began shaving the refractory
Cossacks on the public market-place.
The patients rose in arms,
massacred general, barbers, and aide-de-camps;
recognised Pugatscheff as
Peter III., and swore to replace him
on his throne, and to die in his defence.
The adventurer was near being
as successful as the monk Otrepief.
Catherine herself was very uneasy,
although she published contemptuous
proclamations, and jested, in her letters
to Voltaire, on the Marquis of
Pugatscheff, as she called him. It
was rather a serious subject to joke
about. The impostor defeated Russian
armies, and slew their generals;
took towns, whose governors he impaled;
burned upwards of two hundred
and fifty villages; destroyed the
commerce of Siberia; stopped the
working of the Orenberg mines; and
poured out the blood of thirty thousand
Russian subjects. At last he was
taken. On his trial he showed great
firmness; and, although unable to
read or write, he answered the questions
of the tribunal with wonderful
ability and intelligence. He was condemned
to death. According to the
sentence, his hands were to be cut off
first, then his feet, then his head, and
finally the trunk was to be quartered.
When brought upon the scaffold, and
whilst the imperial ukase enumerating
his crimes was read, he undressed
quickly and in silence; but
when they began to read the sentence,
he dexterously prevented the
executioner from attending to it, by
asking him all manner of questions&mdash;whether
his axe was in good order,
whether the block was not of a less
size than prescribed by law, and
whether he, the executioner, had not,
by chance, drank more brandy than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">676</span>
usual, which might make his hand
unsteady.</p>

<p>"The sentence read, the magistrate
and his assistant left the scaffold.</p>

<p>'Now, then,' said Pugatscheff to
the executioner, 'let us have no mistakes;
the prescribed order must be
strictly observed. So you will first
cut off my head&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The head first!' cried the executioner.</p>

<p>'So runs the sentence. Have a
care! I have friends who would
make you dearly expiate an error to
my prejudice.'</p>

<p>It was too late to call back the
magistrate; and the executioner, who
doubted, at last said to himself that
the important affair, after all, was the
death of the criminal, and that there
was little difference whether it took
place rather sooner or rather later.
He grasped his axe; Pugatscheff laid
his head on the block, and the next
moment it rebounded upon the scaffold.
The feet and hands were cut
off after death; the culprit escaping
torture by his great presence of
mind."</p>

<p>It has been asserted that an order
from the empress thus humanised the
cruel sentence; but this is exceedingly
improbable, for she was bitter
against Pugatscheff, who, ignorant
Cossack as he was, had made the
modern Semiramis tremble on her
throne; besides, it is matter of history
that, after his execution, the
headsman had his tongue cut out, and
was sent to Siberia. Catherine, who
had affected to laugh at Pugatscheff
during his life, was so ungenerous as
to calumniate him after death. "This
brigand," she said, in one of her letters
quoted by M. Blanc, "showed himself
so pusillanimous in his prison, that it
was necessary to prepare him with
caution to hear his sentence read, lest
he should die of fear." It is quite
certain, M. Blanc observes, that to
his dying hour Pugatscheff inspired
more fear than he felt.</p>

<p>The misfortunes of the unhappy
young Princess Tarrakanoff supply M.
Blanc with materials for the most interesting
chapter in this volume of his
work. The Empress Elizabeth, daughter
of Peter the Great, and predecessor
of Peter III.&mdash;whose marriage with the
Princess of Anhalt Zerbest, afterwards
Catherine the Great, was brought about
by her&mdash;had had three children by her
secret marriage with Alexis Razumoffski.
The youngest of these was a
daughter, who was brought up in
Russia under the name of the Princess
Tarrakanoff. When Catherine
trampled the rights of Poland under
foot, the Polish prince, Charles Radzivil,
carried off the young princess,
and took her to Italy, thinking to set
her up at some future day as a pretender
to the Russian throne. Informed
of this, Catherine confiscated
his estates; and in order to live, he
was compelled to sell the diamonds
and other valuables he had taken with
him to Italy. These resources exhausted,
Radzivil set out for Poland
to seek others, leaving the young
princess, then in her sixteenth year,
at Rome, under the care of a sort of
governess or duenna. On reaching
his native country he was offered the
restoration of his property if he would
bring back his ward to Russia. He
refused; but he was so base as to
promise that he would take no further
trouble about her, and leave her
to her fate. Catherine pardoned him,
and forthwith put Alexis Orloff on
the scent. He was a keen bloodhound,
she well knew, capable of any
villany that might serve his ambition.
Gold unlimited was placed at his disposal,
and promise of high reward if he
discovered the retreat of the princess,
and lured her within Catherine's
reach. Orloff set out for Italy; and
on arriving there he took into his employ
a Neapolitan named Ribas, a
sort of spy, styling himself a naval
officer, who pledged himself to find
out the princess, but stipulated for
rank in the Russian navy as his reward.
M. Blanc asserts that he demanded
to be made admiral at once;
and that Orloff, afraid, notwithstanding
the extensive powers given him,
to bestow so high a grade, or compelled
by the suspicions of Ribas to
produce the commission itself, wrote
to Catherine, who at once sent the
required document. Whether this be
exact or not, more than one historian
mentions that Ribas subsequently
commanded in the Black Sea as a
Russian vice-admiral. When certain
of his reward, Ribas, who then had
spent two months in researches, revealed
the retreat of the unfortunate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">677</span>
princess. With some abridgment we
will follow M. Blanc, whose narrative
agrees, in all the main points, with
the most authentic versions of this
touching and romantic history.</p>

<p>The princess was at Rome. Abandoned
by Radzivil, she was reduced
to the greatest penury, existing only
by the aid of a woman who had been
her servant, and who now served
other masters. Alexis Orloff visited
her in her miserable abode, and spoke
at first in the tone of a devoted slave
addressing his sovereign; he told her
she was the legitimate empress of
Russia; that the entire population of
that great empire anxiously longed
for her accession; that if Catherine
still occupied the throne, it was only
because nobody knew where she (the
princess) was hidden; and that her
appearance amongst her faithful subjects,
would be a signal for the instant
downfall of the usurper. Notwithstanding
her youth, the princess mistrusted
these dazzling assurances;
she was even alarmed by them, and
held herself upon her guard. Then
Orloff, one of the handsomest men of
his time, joined the seductions of love
to those of ambition; he feigned a
violent passion for the young girl, and
swore that his life depended on his
obtaining her heart and hand. The
poor isolated girl fell unresistingly
into the infamous snare spread for her
inexperience: she believed and loved
him. The infamous Orloff persuaded
her that their marriage must be
strictly private, lest Catherine should
hear of it and take precautions. In
the night he brought to her house a
party of mercenaries, some wearing
the costumes of priests of the Greek
church, others magnificently attired
to act as witnesses. The mockery of
a marriage enacted, the princess willingly
accompanied Alexis Orloff,
whom she believed her husband, to
Leghorn, where entertainments of all
sorts were given to her. The Russian
squadron, at anchor off the port, was
commanded by the English Admiral
Greig. This officer, either the dupe
or the accomplice of Orloff, invited
the princess to visit the vessels that
were soon to be commanded in her
name. She accepted, and embarked
after a banquet, amidst the acclamations
of an immense crowd: the cannon
thundered, the sky was bright,
every circumstance conspired to give
her visit the appearance of a brilliant
festival. From her flag-bedecked
galley she was hoisted in a splendid
arm-chair on board the admiral's vessel,
where she was received with the
honours due to a crowned head. Until
then Orloff had never left her
side for an instant. Suddenly the
scene changed. Orloff disappeared:
in place of the gay and smiling officers
who an instant previously had obsequiously
bowed before her, the unfortunate
victim saw herself surrounded
by men of sinister aspect, one of
whom announced to her that she was
prisoner by order of the Empress Catherine,
and that soon she would be
brought to trial for the treason she
had attempted. The princess thought
herself in a dream. With loud cries
she summoned her husband to her
aid; her guardians laughed in her
face, and told her she had had a
lover, but no husband, and that her
marriage was a farce. Her despair
at these terrible revelations amounted
to frenzy; she burst into sobs
and reproaches, and at last swooned
away. They took advantage of her
insensibility to put fetters on her feet
and hands, and lower her into the
hold. A few hours later the squadron
sailed for Russia. Notwithstanding
her helplessness and entreaties, the
poor girl was kept in irons until her
arrival at St Petersburg, when she
was taken before the empress, who
wished to see and question her.</p>

<p>Catherine was old; the Princess
Tarrakanoff was but sixteen, and of
surpassing beauty; the disparity destroyed
her last chance of mercy. But
as there was in reality no charge
against her, and as her trial might
have made too much noise, Catherine,
after a long and secret interview with
her unfortunate prisoner, gave orders
she should be kept in the most rigorous
captivity. She was confined in
one of the dungeons of a prison near
the Neva.</p>

<p>Five years elapsed. The victim of
the heartless Catherine, and of the
villain Orloff, awaited death as the
only relief she could expect; but
youth, and a good constitution,
struggled energetically against torture
and privations. One night, reclining
on the straw that served her as a
bed, she prayed to God to terminate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">678</span>
her sufferings by taking her to himself,
when her attention was attracted
by a low rumbling noise like the
roll of distant thunder. She listened.
The noise redoubled: it became
an incessant roar, which each moment
augmented in power. The poor captive
desired death, and yet she felt
terror; she called aloud, and implored
not to be left alone. A jailer came at
her cries; she asked the cause of the
noise she heard.</p>

<p>"'Tis nothing," replied the stupid
slave; "the Neva overflowing."</p>

<p>"But cannot the water reach us
here?"</p>

<p>"It is here already."</p>

<p>At that moment the flood, making
its way under the door, poured into
the dungeon, and in an instant captive
and jailer were over the ankles in
water.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, let us leave
this!" cried the young princess.</p>

<p>"Not without orders; and I have
received none."</p>

<p>"But we shall be drowned!"</p>

<p>"That is pretty certain. But
without special orders I am not to
let you leave this dungeon, under pain
of death. In case of unforeseen danger
I am to remain with you, and
to kill you should rescue be attempted."</p>

<p>"Good God! the water rises. I
cannot sustain myself."</p>

<p>The Neva, overflowing its banks,
floated enormous blocks of ice, upsetting
everything in its passage, and inundating
the adjacent country. The
water now plashed furiously against
the prison doors: the sentinels had
been carried away by the torrent, and
the other soldiers on guard had taken
refuge on the upper floors. Lifted off
her feet by the icy flood which still
rose higher, the unfortunate captive
fell and disappeared; the jailer, who
had water to his breast, hung his
lamp against the wall, and tried to
succour his prisoner; but when he
succeeded in raising her up, she was
dead! The possibility anticipated by
his employers was realised; there had
been stress of circumstances, and the
princess being dead, he was at liberty to
leave the dungeon. Bearing the corpse
in his arms, he succeeded in reaching
the upper part of the prison.</p>

<p>If we may offer a hint to authors,
it is our opinion that this tragical
anecdote will be a godsend to
some romance-writer of costive invention,
and on the outlook for a plot.
Very little ingenuity will suffice to
spread over the prescribed quantity
of foolscap the incidents we have
packed into a page. They will dilute
very handsomely into three volumes.
As to characters, the novelist's
work is done to his hand. Here
we have the Empress Catherine,
vindictive and dissolute, persecuting
that "fair girl" the Princess Tarrakanoff,
with the assistance of Orloff,
the smooth villain, and of the
sullen ruffian Ribas. The latter will
work up into a sort of Italian Varney,
and may be dispersed to the elements
by an intentional accident, on board
the ship blown up by Orloff's order,
for the enlightenment of the painter
Hackert. With the exception of
the dungeon-scene, we have given but
a meagre outline of M. Blanc's narrative;
and there are a number of minor
characters that may be advantageously
brought in and expanded.
"This event," says M. Blanc, referring
to the kidnapping of the Princess,
"caused a strong sensation at
Leghorn. Prince Leopold, Grand-duke
of Tuscany, complained bitterly
of it, and would have had Alexis
Orloff arrested; but this vile assassin
of Peter III. maintained that he had
only executed the orders of his sovereign,
who would well know how to
justify him. He was supported, in
this circumstance, by the English
consul, who was his accomplice; and
the Grand-duke, seeing he was not
likely to be the strongest, suffered the
matter to drop." "Some Englishmen,"
another French writer asserts,
"had been so base as to participate
in Alexis Orloff's plot; but others
were far from approving it. They
even blushed to serve under him, and
sent in their resignations. Admiral
Elphinstone was one of these. Greig
was promoted in his place." An
Italian prince, indignant, but timid;
a foreign consul, sold to Russian interests;
a British sailor, spurning the
service of a tyrant. We need say no
more; for we are quite sure that before
they get thus far, the corps of
historical novelists will be handling
their goose-quills.

<h2 id="LETTERS_TO_THE_REV_CHARLES_FUSTIAN">LETTERS TO THE REV. CHARLES FUSTIAN,<br />

<small>AN ANGLO-CATHOLIC.</small></h2>

<h3 id="LETTER_FIRST">LETTER FIRST.</h3>

<p>You object to being called a Puseyite,
or a Tractarian; and as I believe
you never read any of the Tracts, nor
were lucky enough to comprehend
any of Dr Pusey's writings, you are
right to decline the names. But it is
easy to perceive, even from your outward
man, that some great change
has taken place upon you. It is not
for nothing that you wear so very
tight a neckcloth, and so very low-collared
a coat; your buttons also
are peculiarly placed, and there is a
solemnity in your manner of refusing
an invitation to pot-luck on a Friday
which it is edifying to behold. But
all this surely must have a name.
You were intended by your father to
be a clergyman of the Church of
England&mdash;that worthy gentleman
toasted church and king, till a female
reign and premonitory symptoms of
apoplexy reduced him to silence and
water-gruel; but he is as true a defender
of the faith, in his easy gown and
slippers, as ever, and looks with still
increasing surprise at the appearance
of his eldest son, as often as occasional
help in your curacy enables you to
run home. But don't fancy, for a
moment, that I attribute these frequent
visits to your regard for the
fifth commandment alone: no, dear
Charles; for though I grant you are
an excellent son and praiseworthy
brother, I consider you shine with
still greater lustre in the character of
a neighbour, especially to the family
at Hellebore Park. Gradually I have
seen a change almost equal to your
own in the seven fair daughters of
that house; and it is very evident
that, with this change, in some way
or other, you are very intimately connected.
The five daughters of our
neighbour in the Lodge are also very
different from what they were; and
only Miss Lathpins&mdash;who is fifty years
old, and believes good works to be
such filthy rags that she would be quite
ashamed if she were seen putting
half-a-crown into the plate, or sending
coal and flannel to the poor,
and therefore never does it&mdash;continues
the even tenor of her way,
and sighs for a gospel ministry to tell
her how few will achieve the kingdom
of heaven. Every other house
in the parish feels the effects of your
visits. We must have a new almanac
if you come among us much more;
for the very days of the week are no
longer to be recognised. Tuesday,
instead of being the lineal descendant
of Monday, is now known as the heir
presumptive of Wednesday, and does
duty as the eve of something else.
The wife of our physician invited us
to dinner on the Feast of St Ollapod,
which, after great inquiry, we found
meant Monday the 22d. The months
will not long escape&mdash;the weeks are
already doomed&mdash;and, in a few years,
our parish registers will be as difficult
reading as the inscriptions of
Nemroud. Have you taken this
result of your crusade against the
High and Dry into your consideration?
Is it right to leave a worthy
man like our rector&mdash;who conducted
his little ecclesiastical boat with great
comfort to himself and others, keeping
a careful middle channel between the
shoals of Dissent and the mudbanks
of contented Orthodoxy&mdash;to struggle
in his old age against rocks which
you and your female allies have rolled
into the water; with fast-days rearing
their sharp points where there
used to be such safe navigation, and
saint's days and festivals so blocking
up the passage that he can't set his
skiff near enough the shore, to enable
him to visit his parishioners when
they are sick or hungry? You would
pin the poor old fellow for ever into
his pulpit or reading-desk, and he
never would have time to go to the
extremity of his parish, which, you
remember, is five miles from the
church; and, at the Doctor's rate of
riding, occupies him a good part of
the day.</p>

<p>But perhaps you don't know what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">680</span>
occurs as soon as your stay is over,
and we see the skirts of your departing
surtout disappear over Hitherstone
Hill. Immediately the whole
coterie (which, in this instance, is an
undiluted petticoatery) assembles for
consultation. Pretty young girls,
who would have been engaged ten
years ago in the arrangements of a
pic-nic, now lay their graceful and
busy heads together, to effect an alteration
in the height of the pews. My
dear Charles, young ladies are by
nature carpenters; they know all
about hinges, and pannellings, and
glue, by a sort of intuition: and it is
clear to me that, before you return to
us again, the backs of the seats will
be lowered at least a foot, and I shall
have the pleasure of seeing the whole
extent of Tom Holiday's back, and
the undulations of the three Miss
Holiday's figures during the whole of
the lessons. The rector can't hold
out long&mdash;as indeed who could, against
such petitioners? And, after all, it
is only so much wood; an his wife,
who has retained her shape with very
little aid from padding, has no objection
to stand up during the psalms,
nor any inclination to put her light
under a bushel at any time; and
some of the younger people, who have
not attained the stature of the Venus
de Medici, complain that the present
elevation of the backs, if it doesn't
make dints in their bonnets, at all
events cuts them off in the very
middle; and my opposition, I am
sorry to say, ever since I fell asleep
at your sermon on the holiness of
celibacy, is attributed to interested
motives, and therefore you may fairly
expect to find our pews reduced to
the height and appearance of a row
of rabbit-hutches, when you come
back. This point they seem to consider
already gained, and now they
have advanced their parallels against
the Doctor on another side of his
defences.</p>

<p>The Doctor, even in his youth, can
never have run much risk of being
mistaken for Apollo&mdash;his nose was
probably never of a Grecian pattern,
as that ingenious people would certainly
have rounded the point with a
little more skill, and have placed the
nostrils more out of sight. I have
heard his front teeth were far from
symmetrical, and reminded old Major
M'Turk of the charge of Mahratta
irregular horse, by which that heroic
gentleman lost his eye; but as he has
got quit of those spirited, though straggling
defenders, and supplied their
place with a straight-dressed militia
of enamel or bone, which do duty remarkably
well, in spite of the bright
yellow uniform they have lately assumed,
I conclude that he has been a
gainer by the exchange. And, on the
whole, I have no doubt, if there are
some handsomer fellows in the Guards,
and at the universities, there are several
much uglier people to be seen in
this very parish. It can't, therefore,
be for the express purpose of escaping
the sight of his face that they have
begun their operations to force him to
turn his back on them during the
prayers. But this they are thoroughly
resolved on achieving. They have already
once placed the Bible surreptitiously
on the side of the reading
desk, towards the people, leaving the
Prayer-Book on the side towards the
south; and as the Doctor, in the surprise
of the moment, began with his
face in that direction, his elocution
was wasted on the blank wall of the
chancel and the empty pulpit; and
we had the pleasure of an uninterrupted
view of his profile, and a side-hearing
also of his words, which gave
us as complete a silhouette of the
prayers as of the rector. When we
come to the enjoyment of his full-face
reversed, and can leisurely contemplate
his occiput, and the nape of
his neck&mdash;in which, I am sorry to see,
number one so powerfully developed&mdash;we
shall have the farther advantage
of not having our own meditations interrupted
by hearing a syllable he
says. He resists, indeed, at present;
and even told a deputation of ladies
that he would consult common sense
on the occasion, and read so that the
poor folks under the west gallery
could join in every petition. Miss
Araminta&mdash;your Araminta, Charles&mdash;lifted
her beautiful eyes to the Doctor
in surprise, and asked "if he really
prayed <i>to</i> John Simpkins and Peter
Bolt, for surely he could pray <i>for</i>
them, and <i>with</i> them better, with his
face to the altar;" and the Doctor said
something about "girls minding their
own business, and leaving him to his,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">681</span>
which would have led to very unpleasant
consequences, if the rest of
the ambassadors had not interfered,
and smoothed the raven down of the
Doctor's temper by some judicious
declarations of respect for his office,
and contempt for some unfortunate
evangelical brethren in the neighbourhood;
till at last the old man took Araminta
by the hand, and told her, with
great truth, that she was one of the
nicest girls in the world, and that he
would ride fifty miles at a moment's
warning, to save her an instant's discomfort.
So they retired for that time,
hinting that they were rather surprised
that <i>their</i> rector should have used the
same argument which had been employed
by the Rev. Ebenezer Snuffle,
the low church vicar of the adjoining
village. A telling blow this, Charles,
as you are well aware; for I verily
believe the Doctor would soften towards
the Koran, if his neighbour
made an attack on Mahommed; so I
wait the issue without much uncertainty
as to what it will be. For all
this, I can't help holding you, in a
great measure, responsible; for there
is no shutting one's eyes to the fact,
that a decided step in advance is
taken after every one of your runs
into our parish. Your father, and
Major M'Turk, and I, sink lower and
lower in the estimation of your followers
every day. Instead of the nice
little parties we used to have, where the
girls, most of whom we remember as
infants, used to sing "Lizzie Lindsay"
for the amusement of the old ones, or
play magic music, or games at forfeits,
to please themselves, they now huddle
up in a corner&mdash;if, perchance,
no eve or fast prevents them from
coming out to tea&mdash;and hold deep
consultations on the state and prospects
of the Church. And yet there
is something so innocent and pretty
in the way they manage their plots,
and such a charming feeling of triumph
fills their hearts, when they have
achieved a victory over the habits
and customs of the village, that I
hardly wonder they never pause in
their career, or give ear to the warnings
of stupid old people like the trio
I have named. In the mean time,
they certainly have it all their own
way,&mdash;in the injunctions they have
laid on the poor people, to turn round
at some parts of the service, stand up
at others, and join in the most wonderful
responses, in a set key, which
they call entoning; and they have
tormented the band so much with
practising anthems, that half the
population have turned dissenters in
self-defence; and while the front seats
are filled with satin bonnets and India
shawls, and the rustle of silks is like
the flight of a thousand doves when
the altitude needs to be changed, there
isn't a poor person to be seen in the
church except John Simpkins and
Peter Bolt, and they, I am sorry to
say, are far from being the same quiet
humble paupers they used to be; for
our feminine apostles have been telling
them of the honour and dignity of the
poor, till there is no bearing their
pride and self-conceit. Sometimes,
out of respect to the Doctor, and a
reverence for the old church, the
grocer, the carpenter, and a few of
the shopkeepers, still make their appearance
in the afternoon, but they
are like children the first time they go
to Astley's, and stare with wonder at
all the changes they see; and even our
rector himself has become so confused,
that he doesn't feel altogether sure
that he hasn't turned a dissenter, for
the mode, if not of conducting, at least
of joining in the service, is something
quite different from what he has been
used to.</p>

<p>Now dissent, as you know, has been
the bugbear of the Doctor through life.
The very name carries with it something
inexpressibly dreadful, and
among the most terrifying to him of
all the forms of dissent was that of
Rome. But lately, a vast number of
bright eyes have been lifted to the
ceiling, and a great many beautiful
lips opened, and a great many sweet
voices raised in opposition to any
hostile allusion to the objects of his
abhorrence. "The church of Fenelon,"
says one in a reverential tone, "can
surely not be altogether apostate."
"The church of the two Gregories,
the church of A'Beckett and Dunstan,
of St Senanus, St Januarius, and the
Seven Champions of Christendom, can
never have fallen away from the
faith," exclaims Miss Tinderella
Swainlove in a very contemptuous
tone, when the Doctor contrasts the
great and ambitious names of Rome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">682</span>
with the humility required in a Christian
pastor. "In short, Dr Smiler,
we wish to know," she said not a
week ago, when she had gone up to
the parsonage to practise a Gregorian
chant on Christina Smiler's concertina&mdash;"we
wish to know, Doctor
Smiler, whether religion consists in
bare plaster walls and a cassock?"
"Certainly not, my dear Tinderella,
but you will observe"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, we only want an answer to
that question," said the young lady,
interrupting; "for, allow me to tell
you, we feel our devotion greatly excited
by the noble solemnity of a service
decently conducted with albe and
chasuble, in a building fitted for its
high destination by the richest combination
of architecture and the arts."</p>

<p>Tinderella is nineteen years of age,
and as decided in her manner as a
field-marshal. "May I ask, my dear,
who the 'we' are in whose name you
speak?" inquired the rector.</p>

<p>"Not Mr Ruggles the grocer, nor
Chipper the carpenter, but all who
are qualified by their fortune, and
position in life, to judge on the subject,"
was Tinderella's spirited rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Really," said the Doctor, "you
young ladies are very much changed
from what you were. Two years ago,
I used to have great difficulty in
keeping you from balls and archeries,
and had frequent occasion to lecture
you for inattention in church. What,
in the name of wonder, has come over
you all?"</p>

<p>"Do you find fault with us for
having given up frivolities, and turned
reverent and attentive during the
service?" inquired his questioner with
a sneer.</p>

<p>"Far from it, my dear,&mdash;very far
from it; but I should like very much
to know what is the cause of the
change. I trust, my dear Tinderella,
it isn't connected with the marriage
of Lieutenant Polker, with whom I
remember you danced every night
last winter."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Polker," replied Tinderella,
"has married a dissenter, or
a person of low church principles, and
that is as bad, and he has nothing
whatever to do with our duty to the
Holy Catholic Church I assure you, sir."</p>

<p>"Then it must be that silly, ignorant
coxcomb, Charles Fustian, my
own godson, my favourite from his
youth&mdash;an excellent fellow, but a conceited
ass&mdash;I wish he had never gone
into the diocese of Vexer."</p>

<p>This is the tender way in which
you are spoken of, my dear Charles;
and I feel sure you will appreciate the
compliment paid to you by the Doctor,
losing his temper, but retaining his
affection.</p>

<p>There was a blush on Tinderella's
cheek as she entered into a defence of
"the Reverend Charles Fustian, a
priest of our church;" and she almost
curtsied in reverence for your name
and office; and I advise Araminta to
keep watch over her friend's proceedings,
for I don't think Tinderella is so
deeply attached to the doctrine of celibacy
as she pretends. And I take
this opportunity also, my dear Charles,
to tell you that I shall keep watch
over YOU; and if I find you casting
your smiles at Tinderella, and holding
her by the hand, and recommending
her to enter into the privileges of
confession, in the summer-house in
her father's garden&mdash;and holding forth
all the time on the blessings of a conventual
life and penance, and hair
shirts and a cat-o'-nine-tails&mdash;I shall
be greatly inclined to recur to the
discipline that used to improve your
manners greatly when you were a
little boy, and use the scourge with
more effect than when you apply it to
your shoulders with your own hand.</p>

<p>The Doctor has just been here, and
as I know you will be rejoiced to hear
the news he gave me, I will transmit
it to you at once.</p>

<p>"Buddle," he said to me, "you
have perhaps seen how vainly I have
tried to resist the parish, at least the
young ladies of the parish; for I am
sorry to say, that, with the exception
of yourself and two or three others of
the seniors, the parish has left me to
fight the battle alone."</p>

<p>"My dear Smiler," I replied,
"what can we do? Surely, if we lie
quiet on our oars, the fancy for that
sort of thing will go off."</p>

<p>"Not at all; as they get older it
will get worse. There is some hope for
them when they are very young, but
in a few years there is no chance of
escaping a universal passing over to
the Pope; and between ourselves,"&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">683</span>
here the Doctor looked at the
door, as if he wished to bolt it with a
twist of his eye&mdash;"I am in great
anxiety of mind lest they carry me
with them. Yes, my good Buddle,
it would not surprise me if I awoke
some morning and found myself a
monk."</p>

<p>"How? Haven't you signed the
articles and repeated the creed, and
the oath of abjuration, and all that?"</p>

<p>"That is no defence. Those girls
go to work so scientifically, carrying
one object first, and then another; and
they are so good, and active, and amiable,
and so useful in the parish, and
so clever, and defer so respectfully to
my judgment in all things, that I find
there is not an alteration which has
taken place in the parish that I did
not at first oppose, and end in a very
short time by ordering on my own
authority. Yes, my dear friend, I
feel that, if not supported by some
person of stout uncompromising church
principles, I shall probably find myself
eating fish on Fridays, and administering
castigation to myself in my
old age, and listening to young ladies'
confessions, and flogging Araminta or
Tinderella in atonement for their tasting
a mutton-chop on a fast-day."</p>

<p>"It would do them both a great
deal of good."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, my dear Buddle;
and if they were five or six years
younger, such things would soon be
put out of their heads." And here he
clenched his hand on his riding switch,
and looked like the picture of Doctor
Busby. "But, as it is, I think I have
stolen a march on them. Look at
that."</p>

<p>So saying, he pointed to an advertisement
in the <i>Record</i> newspaper,
which stated that "a curate was
wanted for a country parish; he must
be under thirty, an eloquent preacher
and reader; and, finally, that no Tractarian
need apply."</p>

<p>"And he's coming, sir; the Reverend
Algernon Sidney Mount Huxtable;
a man of good family, tolerable
fortune, and highly orthodox principles,
is coming! I expect him next
week, and as he is only eight-and-twenty,
and unmarried, I think he
will be an excellent assistant in repelling
these attacks on our admirable
Establishment."</p>

<p>So, with this piece of information,
my dear Charles, I conclude, as I am
anxious to go through the houses in
the village, and see the effect of the
announcement on the charming little
army which Major M'Turk irreverently
calls St Ursula's dragoons.</p>

<h3 id="LETTER_SECOND">LETTER SECOND.</h3>

<p>On Monday last, our new curate
came; a most gentlemanly-mannered
good-looking young man, with very
dark eyes and very white teeth; and
I was pleased to observe, when I
dined with him the first day at the
parsonage, that he did not consider
these advantages as merely ornamental,
but made excellent use of
both. He did yeoman's service upon
the fish and mutton, and cast glances
on Miss Christina Smiler that made
her at once give up the opposition she
had made to her father's proposal of
keeping a curate, and proved, to his
entire satisfaction, that it was the
best arrangement in the world. A
pleasant good-humoured companion, a
man of the world, and an unflinching
son and servant of the Church, gaining
the rector's confidence by an attack
on Popery, and winning the ladies'
affection by a spirited tirade on the
vulgarity of dissent.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said the Doctor,
after the ladies had withdrawn, and
we had filled our glasses with the first
bumper of port,&mdash;"the fact is, my
dear Mount Huxtable, that our parish
is in a very curious condition. We
are all devoted members of the Church,
and yet we are very suspicious of
each other. The inhabitants, especially
the young lady part of them, have
taken such an interest lately in the
affairs of the parish, and are so unanimous
in enforcing their own wishes,
both on me and the churchwardens&mdash;not
to mention my stanch and kind
friends Major M'Turk and Mr Buddle&mdash;that
we feel as if the revolutionary
spirit had extended to this village, and
the regular authorities had been deposed
by a Committee of Public Safety."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">684</span></p>

<p>"Do they <i>enforce</i> their wishes?"
inquired the new curate, with a frown,
and laying great emphasis on the
word enforce.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Rector, a little
puzzled, "that's rather a strong
word. Do you think we can call it
enforce, Major M'Turk?"</p>

<p>"They say they'll do it, and it's
done," was the reply of the military
commander.</p>

<p>"And you, Buddle?"</p>

<p>"No; you can't call it enforce,"
said I; "for they are the meekest,
sweetest, and most submissive people
I ever met with."</p>

<p>"That's right; I'm glad to hear it,"
said Mount Huxtable. "And do
they really succeed in all the efforts
they make?"</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it," said the Rector,
looking rather confused. "The
church is entirely different from what
it was a year ago; even the service,
by some means or other, has got into
quite a different order; I find myself
walking about in my surplice, and
standing up at doxologies, and sometimes
attempting to sing the Jubilate
after the second lesson, though I never
had a voice, and it does not seem to
be set to any particular tune. And,
in confidence between ourselves, I
think they could make me of any religion
they chose."</p>

<p>"They're the fittest missionaries for
the Mahommedan faith," said Major
M'Turk; "such Houris may always
count on me for a convert."</p>

<p>The Curate sank into silence.</p>

<p>"You're not afraid of such antagonists,
Mount Huxtable?" inquired
the Rector.</p>

<p>"I don't think they are at all to be
feared as antagonists," he replied, with
a smile, as if assured of the victory.</p>

<p>And when we looked at his handsome
face, and the glow of true orthodox
determination that brightened in
his eyes, we were all of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>"But we won't let them see the
battery we have prepared against
them," continued the jubilant Rector,
"till we are in a position to take the
field. I have applied to the bishop
for a license for you for two years, so
that, whatever complaints they make
against your proceedings, nothing can
get you removed from the parish; the
whole onus of the fight will be thrown
on your shoulders; and all I can say
to them, when they come to me with
their grievances, will be, my dear
Araminta, my dear Sophronia, my
charming little Anastasia, Mr Mount
Huxtable is in the entire charge of
the parish, and from his decision
there is no appeal."</p>

<p>The happiest man in England that
night was the Reverend Doctor Smiler
of Great Yawnham, for he had now
the assurance of preserving the orthodoxy
of his parish, without the pain of
quarrelling with his parishioners.</p>

<p>"Good night, good night," he said,
as M'Turk and I walked away, while
Mount Huxtable got into his phaeton
and whisked his greys very showily
down the avenue, "I think that
ewe-necked donkey, Charles Fustian,
won't be quite so popular with the
Blazers at Hellebore Park, in spite of
Araminta's admiration of his long
back and white neckcloth."</p>

<p>"Mount Huxtable will cut him out
in every house in the parish," replied
Major M'Turk; and I said,</p>

<p>"I know Charles very well, and
like him immensely; he won't yield
without a struggle, and, in fact, I have
no doubt he will proceed to excommunication."</p>

<p>Pardon us all, my dear Charles, for
the free-and-easy way we speak of
you. I don't believe three old fellows
in England are fonder of you than we;
and no wonder&mdash;for haven't we all
known you from your cradle, and
traced you through all your career
since you were hopelessly the booby
of the dame's school, till you were
twice plucked at Oxford, and proved
how absurdly the dons of that university
behaved, by obtaining your degree
from Dublin by a special favour.
Would a learned body have treated a
very decided fool with special favour?
No; and therefore I think Dr Smiler
and M'Turk are sometimes a great
deal too strong in their language; but
you must forgive them, for it proceeds
from the fulness of their hearts.</p>

<p>The license arrived next day, and
a mighty tea-drinking was held last
night at the parsonage, to enable the
Doctor to present his curate to the
parish. The Blazers came in from
Hellebore Park, Araminta looking
beautiful in a plain nun-like white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">685</span>
gown, with a cross and rosary of jet
falling tastefully over her breast. The
Swainloves came from the Lodge, the
spirited Tinderella labouring under
two prodigious folios of Gregorian
chants. Sophronia and her grandmamma
came up from the vale; and,
in short, the whole rank and beauty
of the village assembled. The manly
dignity of that charming district was
represented by myself and Major
M'Turk; your father, who came down
in his wheel-chair; Dr Pulser and his
son Arthur, who has lately settled
down here, with a brass plate on the
surgery door, announcing that he is
attorney-at-law. Arthur, you remember,
has a beautiful voice, and he entones
the responses like a nightingale.</p>

<p>We were all assembled before the
guest of the evening arrived. For the
thousandth time we admired the garden
and lawn, and heard how the
Doctor had altered the house, and
levelled the grounds, and thrown out
bow-windows, and made the whole
thing the perfect bijou it is. The
fuschias were in full bloom, the
grass nicely mown, and the windows
being open, we could sally forth on to
the terrace walk, and admire the
pleasure-grounds as we chose. But
nobody moved. Christina Smiler sat
at the piano, but did not play; she
kept her eyes constantly fixed on the
door,&mdash;as indeed did several of the
other young ladies; and when at last
wheels were heard rapidly approaching,
and a loud knock resounded
through the house, the amount of
blushing was immense; the bloom of
so many cheeks would have recalled
to an original-minded poet a bed of
roses, and old M'Turk kicked my
shins unobserved, and whispered, "We
shall get quit of the female parliament
very soon: this is the Cromwell of
the petticoats."</p>

<p>As he felt that he made his appearance,
on this occasion, in his professional
character, Mr Mount Huxtable
was arrayed in strictly clerical costume.
Your own tie, my dear Charles,
could not have been more accurately
starched, nor your coat more episcopally
cut. There was the apostolic
succession clearly defined on the buttons;
and, between ourselves, we
were enchanted with the fine taste
that showed that a man might be a
good stout high churchman without
being altogether an adherent of the
Patristics. His introduction was excellently
got over, and the charming
warmth with which he shook hands
with the young people, after doing his
salutation to us of the preterite generation,
showed that his attention was
not confined to the study of the fathers,
but had a pretty considerable leaning
to the daughters also.</p>

<p>"So much the better, my boy,"
said M'Turk, "he'll have them all
back to the good old ways in a trice;
we shall have picnics again on Fridays,
and little dances every day in the
week." Tea was soon finished, and
Tinderella Swainlove, without being
asked by anybody, as far as I could
see, walked majestically to the piano,
and laying open a huge book, gave
voice with the greatest impetuosity to
a Latin song, which she afterwards
(turning round on the music-stool,
and looking up in Mr Mount Huxtable's
face) explained to be a hymn
to the Virgin. But the gentleman did
not observe that the explanation was
addressed to him, and continued his
conversation with Christina Smiler.
In a few minutes he accompanied her
out of the window into the garden,
and the other young ladies caught occasional
glimpses of the pair as they
crossed the open spaces between the
shrubs. The Doctor rubbed his hands
with delight, and Mrs Smiler could
scarcely conceal her gratification. But
these feelings were not entertained by
the Swainloves. Tinderella looked
rather disappointed to her mother; and
that lady addressed Major M'Turk in
rather a bitter tone of voice, and said
it was a pity the curate was so awkward,
and asked how long he had
been lame.</p>

<p>"He is by no means lame," replied
the Major; "you'll learn that before
long, by the dance he'll show you."</p>

<p>"Does he dance?" inquired Mrs
Swainlove, anxiously. "As you're at
the piano, my dear Tinderella, will
you play us that charming polka you
used to play last year?"</p>

<p>A polka!&mdash;it was the first that had
been demanded for a long time; and,
in the surprise and gratification of the
moment, the Major took her affectionately
by the hand. Tinderella played
as required; and great was the effect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">686</span>
of her notes: first one fair lady, and
then another, found the room too hot;
and before many minutes elapsed, we,
who sat near the window, saw the
whole assembly, except the performer
on the piano, grouped round the new
curate, who seemed giving them lectures
on botany, for he held some
flowers in his hand, and was evidently
very communicative to them all. Mrs
Swainlove, seeing her stratagem of no
avail, told Tinderella to stop, and the
conversation was entirely limited to
the men who stayed behind. Young
Pulser, the attorney, had joined the
party in the garden, and the senior
ladies, with the discomfited musician,
soon also retired.</p>

<p>"He'll do," said the Major confidentially&mdash;"he's
the very man for our
money; and all things considered&mdash;not
forgetting my friend Christina
among the rest&mdash;you never did a wiser
thing in your life, my dear Smiler."</p>

<p>"He seems a sure hand among the
girls," said your father, "and I
haven't had a chance of a minute's
talk with him. I wanted to speak
to him about my son Charles."</p>

<p>"He'll give you good advice about
breaking in that stiff-necked young
gentleman," said the Rector, "and
we must contrive to get them acquainted."</p>

<p>"Bless ye," said your father,
"they're very well acquainted already.
He lived in Charles's parish in the
diocese of Vexer, and was a great favourite,
I'm told, of the bishop."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear fellow," said
the Doctor, taken a little aback, "he
can't possibly be a favourite of such a
firebrand&mdash;it must be some one else;
and, besides, he never told me he was
a friend of your son."</p>

<p>"You can ask him," replied your
father, "for I'm quite sure I've often
heard Charles talk of his friend Mount
Huxtable."</p>

<p>A dead silence fell upon us all.
Strange, we thought, that he should
never have alluded to his acquaintance
with you. Can he be ashamed of the
way you have been going on? Is he
afraid of being suspected of the same
ludicrous feastings and fastings that
have given you such a reputation here?</p>

<p>"Pray, my dear Mount Huxtable,"
said Dr Smiler, when the new curate,
accompanied by the young ladies&mdash;like
the proud-walking, long-necked
leader of a tribe of beautiful snow-white
geese&mdash;entered the room,
"have you ever met our excellent
friend, Charles Fustian?"</p>

<p>"Fustian&mdash;Fustian?" replied the
Curate, trying to recollect. "There
are so many of that name in the Church,
I surely ought to have met with one
of them."</p>

<p>The Doctor nodded his head, quite
satisfied, to your father.</p>

<p>"You see, you see," he said, with
a chuckle.</p>

<p>"I see nothing of the sort," said
your progenitor; "for though Fustian
is common enough in the Church, I'm
sure Mount Huxtable isn't."</p>

<p>"That's true," said the Doctor.
"Pray, how do you account for
Charles Fustian happening to know
YOU?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sir," answered
Mount Huxtable, with a smile to the
ladies, "there is an old byword, which
says more people know Tom Fool than
Tom Fool knows."</p>

<p>A great laugh rewarded this sally,
and the Doctor's triumph over his
neighbours was complete.</p>

<p>"I told you what it would come
to," he said; "no true orthodox
churchman can have any acquaintance
with such a semi-papist as poor
Charles."</p>

<p>The conversation now went on in
the usual channel&mdash;that is to say, we
talked a little politics, which was very
uninteresting, for we all agreed; and
the young ones attacked the Curate on
music and painting, and church architecture,
on all which subjects he
managed to give them great satisfaction,
for he was an excellent musician,
a tolerable artist, and might have
passed anywhere for a professional
builder. I suppose they were as much
astonished as pleased to find that a
man might be an opponent of the
Tracts, and yet be as deep in church
matters as themselves. Encouraged
by this, they must have pushed their
advances rather far for a first meeting;
for, after an animated conversation
in the bow-window, Araminta
and two or three other young ladies
came to the Doctor's chair.</p>

<p>"Only think, dear Doctor Smiler,"
she said, "how unkind Mr Mount
Huxtable is. Next Thursday, our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">687</span>
practising day in the church, is the
Feast of holy St Ingulpus of Doncaster,
and he won't give us leave to
ornament the altar with flowers."</p>

<p>"And who in the world is St Ingulpus
of Doncaster?" said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"A holy man, I don't in the least
deny," said Mount Huxtable, kindly
taking the answer on himself. "His
acts and writings attest his virtues
and power; but I merely mentioned
to the young ladies, as the easiest way
of settling the affair, that St Ingulpus,
though most justly canonised by the
holy father in the thirteenth century,
was not elevated to the degree
of worship or veneration by the succeeding
councils."</p>

<p>"And you answered them very
well, sir," said the Doctor. "And as
to St Ingulpus of Doncaster, I never
heard of him, and believe him to have
been an impostor, like the holy father,
as you ironically call him, who pretended
to canonise him."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" said Christina, addressing
her father, but looking all
the time at the Curate, "Mr Mount
Huxtable himself confesses he was a
holy man."</p>

<p>"What?&mdash;do <i>you</i> join in such
follies? Go to bed, or learn to behave
less like a child. Mr Mount Huxtable
accommodates his language to the
weakness of his auditors; but in reality
he has as great a contempt for this
Ingulpus, or any other popish swindler,
as I have."</p>

<p>The Doctor was now so secure of
support from his curate, that he felt
bold enough to get into a passion. If
he had fired a pistol at his guests, he
could scarcely have created a greater
sensation. The effect on Christina
was such that she clung for support to
Mount Huxtable, and rested her head
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mr Mount Huxtable," continued
the Rector, "has forbidden you to
disfigure my church with flowers. Mr
Mount Huxtable has the entire charge
of this parish, and from his decision
there is no appeal."</p>

<p>This knock-down blow he had kept
for the last; and it had all the effect
he expected. They were silent for a
long time. "That has settled them,
I think," he whispered to me; "they
know me to be such a good-natured
old fool, and so fond of them all, that
in time they might have turned me
round their thumbs; but Mount Huxtable
is a different man. At the same
time, I must'nt have the darlings too
harshly used. I daresay I was a little
too bitter in the way I spoke: I can't
bear to see any of them unhappy,&mdash;something
must be done to amuse
them."</p>

<p>If the Doctor had done them all
some serious injury, he could not
have been more anxious to atone for
it. He spoke to each of them, patted
them on the head, told them they were
good girls, and that he loved them all
like his own children; and even went
so far as to say that, if the matter was
entirely in his hands, he didn't know
but that he might have allowed them
to make what wreaths and posies they
liked on Thursday. "And as to your
friend Ingulpus," he concluded, "I
hope and trust he was a good man
according to his lights, and probably
had no intention to deceive. So, my
dear Mount Huxtable, as your uncompromising
Protestantism is the
cause of disappointment to my young
flock, I must punish you by insisting
on your immediately singing them a
song."</p>

<p>"The young ladies, sir, shall find I
am not so uncompromising a Protestant
as they fear, for you see I don't
even protest against the justice of your
sentence;" and with this he took his
seat at the piano. "The song I shall
attempt is not a very new one," he
said, "for it was written in the year
a thousand and forty by a monk of
Cluny. The Benedictines, you will
remember, have at all times been devoted
to music." So saying, he threw
his hand over the keys, and after a
prelude, sang in a fine manly voice&mdash;</p>

<p>Astonishment and delight kept the
company silent for a while after he
had finished, and then the repressed
feelings of the audience burst out with
tenfold force. "Oh, Mr Mount
Huxtable!" said they all, "you <i>must</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">688</span>
attend our Thursday practising in the
church. It will be so delightful now,
for all we required was a fine man's
voice. How beautiful the words are,
and how well adapted for singing!
And the music, how splendid!&mdash;pray
whose is the music?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must confess myself
the culprit in that respect," replied
the Curate, very modestly. "I have
been an enthusiast in music all my
life, and have a peculiar delight in
composing melodies to the old Catholic
hymns."</p>

<p>After this no more was said of
flowers on St Ingulpus's day; and it
was very evident that our new ally
was carrying the war into the enemy's
country, and, in fact, was turning
their artillery against themselves.</p>

<p>"If you are pleased with this simple
song, I am sure that you will all be
enchanted next week with two friends
who have promised to visit me&mdash;both
exquisite musicians, and very clever
men."</p>

<p>"Clergymen?" inquired two or
three of the ladies.</p>

<p>"Of course. I have very few lay
acquaintances. You perhaps have
heard their names,&mdash;the Reverend
Launton Swallowlies, and the Reverend
Iscariot Rowdy, both of Oxford."</p>

<p>"No we don't know their names,
but shall be delighted to see any
friends of yours." And so the party
broke up with universal satisfaction.
There was a brilliant moon, and Mount
Huxtable sent away his phaeton and
two beautiful gray ponies, and walked
to Hellebore gate with the Blazers.
Christina Smiler would rather have
had him drive home, and looked a
little sad as they went off: but we
heard happy voices all the way down
the avenue; snatches of psalm-music,
even, rose up from the shrubs that
line the walk; and it appears that
the whole group had stopt short on
the little knoll that rises just within
the parsonage gate, and sung the
Sicilian Mariner's Hymn.</p>

<p>So I think, my dear Charles, you
may give up any farther attempts on
our good old Church principles; the
Doctor is determined not to turn round
to the communion-table even at the
creed, and I will beat you £20 that
the congregation will all come back
again, and we shall once more be a
happy and united parish.</p>

<h3 id="LETTER_THIRD">LETTER THIRD.</h3>

<p>We look on you now, my dear
Charles, as a fallen star; and, between
ourselves, I don't think you are missed
by a single astronomer in Yawnham,
from the sky where you were once
enthroned. No, sir: our curate's
neckcloth is stiffer than yours, his
collar plainer, his tails longer, his knowledge
of saints and legends infinitely
deeper&mdash;and, besides, he sings like an
angel, and has a phaeton and pair.
And he is so gentlemanly, too. He
was at Eton, and is intimate with
many lords, and has a power of sneering
at low churchmen and dissenters
that would be myrrh and incense to
the Pope. Now you will observe,
my unfortunate young friend, that
when gentlemanly manners, good looks
and accomplishments&mdash;not to mention
an intimacy with the Red Book&mdash;and
fourteen hundred a-year are in one
scale, and Charles Fustian and a ton
weight of Tractarians are in the other,
the young persons who, in our parish,
hold the beam will very soon send
you and your make-weights half-way
through the roof. Therefore, if you
wish to retrieve your influence, either
with Araminta or the other fair innovators,
now or never is your time;
come down and visit us. We shall
all be delighted to see your elongated
visage, and are not without
hopes&mdash;for you are a good-natured
excellent-dispositioned fellow after all&mdash;that
you will see the error of your
ways, and believe that humility and
charity are Christian graces as well
as faith and coloured windows. It so
happens that there is scarcely a house
in the place without a visitor. Tom
Blazer has come down to Hellebore
Park, and has brought Jones and
Smith, two of his brother officers of the
Rifles, with him;&mdash;the two Oxford
men are with Mount Huxtable, who
has taken Laburnum Place, and our
doings are likely to be uncommonly
gay. Swallowlies and Rowdy are
great friends, though they seem to be
the very antipodes of each other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">689</span>
Rowdy won't believe anything, and
has doubts about the battle of Waterloo;
and Swallowlies believes everything,
and thinks the American States
will soon pay off my bonds. Rowdy
says there is no evidence, satisfactory
to him, that there is such a state as
Arkansas in the world, as it is not authoritatively
stated by church or
council; and tries to persuade me
that I have lent six thousand pounds
of real money to an imaginary republic.
In the mean time, the loss of three
hundred a-year is by no means an imaginary
evil, and I feel a little sore at
both these Oxford humourists for
laughing at my misfortunes. However,
Swallowlies errs on the right side, and
is decidedly the favourite with us all.</p>

<p>You may guess, my dear Charles,
how the heart of Major M'Turk jumped
for joy when Mount Huxtable proposed
a pic-nic at the Holywell tree
at the other extremity of the parish;
and all the young ladies, without a
single exception, determined to be of
the party. Fasting, my good friend,
has come to an end: there were pies
enough made to feed an army; baskets
by the dozen were packed up, containing
plates, and knives and forks;
crates filled with cold fowls and hams,
and others loaded with fruit and wine.
The Rector had out his old coach,
which Chipper managed to decapitate
for the occasion, and it did duty (like
St Denis) with its head off, as an open
barouche. He took some of the Puginstones,
and two of the Pulsers; and, to
make room for Mrs M'Turk, he, or rather
Mrs Smiler, asked the Curate to take
Christina beside him on the driving-seat
of his phaeton. I got out my old
four-wheel, which was certainly not
so fashionable-looking as Mount Huxtable's
drag, but so commodious that
it appears made of India-rubber, and
stretches to any extent. Tom Blazer
is an ostentatious fool and sports a
tandem&mdash;that is to say, he puts his
own horse and Jones' (one before the
other) in his father's high gig, and insists
on driving Tinderella Swainlove
all about the country. On this
occasion she also graced his side; and
Jones himself, who is as active as one
of the Voltigeurs at Astley's, fixed a
board on the hind part of the gig and
sat with his back to the horse, smoking
cigars and calling it a dog-cart.
At last we all got there; and, when
the company was assembled, it certainly
was a goodly sight to see.
The little spring that gives its name
to the fine old elm&mdash;now, alas! a stump
that might pass for Arthur's Table
Round&mdash;comes welling out from a glorious
old rock, which rises suddenly,
you remember, from the richest pasture
field in yeoman Ruffhead's farm. I
never saw the scenery to such advantage:
the woods of Kindstone Hill
closed in the landscape on the west;
and before us, to the south, was spread
out the long sunny level of Richland
meads, at the farther extremity
of which rose the time-honoured ivy-covered
ruins of Leeches Abbey.
While the servants, who had gone over
in a couple of carts, were busy in arranging
the repast, we fell off into
parties, and, by mere accident, I joined
the Blazer girls and Captain Smith,
who gathered round the Holywell,
and told what little legends they knew
of it to Swallowlies and Rowdy.</p>

<p>"They thought it was good for epileptic
fits," said Araminta, "in the Roman
Catholic time. It was blessed by St
Toper of Geneva, who was overcome
by thirst one morning after spending
the night with the monks of Leeches."</p>

<p>"Toper of Geneva?" inquired
Captain Smith,&mdash;"it's rather a jolly
name for a saint; no wonder the old
boy felt his coppers hot after a night
with the monks."</p>

<p>But the remark was so coldly received
that the Captain, who enjoys a
great reputation in the Rifles for wit
and pleasantry, was for a while struck
dumb.</p>

<p>"Who shall tell what may be the
efficacy of a good man's blessing,"
said Mr Swallowlies, dipping his finger
reverently in the cow's drinking
trough, and touching his forehead.
"Do you know, Miss Blazer, if it
still retains its virtue?"</p>

<p>"I believe epileptic patients are
still brought to the spring," replied
Araminta, "and I have heard that
the old woman in that little hut on
the hill-side has seen several cures."</p>

<p>"I will make her acquaintance this
moment," exclaimed Swallowlies. "I
think it a privilege to look on a matron
who has witnessed so remarkable a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_690">690</span>
manifestation. Will you go with me,
Rowdy?"</p>

<p>"No, I have no great faith in the
fountain."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it is a sufficient effort for
the human mind to have faith in one
or two points of far greater importance."</p>

<p>"But you needn't make any effort
at all. Take it on the assurance of
the Church," said Swallowlies persuasively.
"We have, indeed, cut
ourselves off from a declaration of our
belief in the power of saints like the
holy Toper; but we can surely entertain
the belief, though we are debarred
from making public profession of it.
And, in fact, any one who believes in
miracles at all must equally believe
that this spring will cure epileptic
fits."</p>

<p>"Exactly as I say," responded
Rowdy; "all miracles are equally
credible."</p>

<p>"Then come to the old woman,"
said Swallowlies, taking his arm.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr Rowdy, "I have
lately had great doubts as to my own
identity, and I am going to try some
experiments to see whether I am now
the same person I was when I signed
the articles, and did duty in my
parish."</p>

<p>Mr Swallowlies, however, and the
rest of us, with the exception of Captain
Smith, walked to old Janet
Wheedler's cottage, while Rowdy entered
on his course of experimental
philosophy. We found her nicely
dressed, as if in expectation of our
coming; and as the spring, with its
capabilities for a pic-nic and its ancient
associations, was a source of considerable
revenue to her, she evidently was
greatly pleased with the number of
guests whom she saw approaching her
door.</p>

<p>"<i>Pax vobiscum!</i>" said Mr Swallowlies,
as we entered the cottage. "You
reside here in highly favoured ground."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir," said Janet,
"the gentlefolks be very fond of it,
and very often come here from all
parts about."</p>

<p>"Only the gentlefolks?" inquired
her visitor. "I thought I heard that
others came to avail themselves of
the holy spring."</p>

<p>"Some folks don't believe in it now,
sir&mdash;more's the pity. It was of great
value in the old time."</p>

<p>"Why should it lose its virtue, Mrs
Wheedler? If we had still the faith,
it would have still the power."</p>

<p>Janet looked towards Mr Swallowlies,
to judge whether he was in jest
or earnest; but, on catching the face
of wonderment with which he gazed
at the well, and the unmistakable
sincerity with which he spoke, the old
woman, who had been a fortune-teller
in her youth, involuntarily winked her
blear eye, and curled up the corners
of her mouth.</p>

<p>"It ain't quite falled away yet, sir.
This here cat as ever you sees&mdash;here,
Tabby dear, get up and show yourself
to the gentles&mdash;this here cat, sir, a
week ago, was took so ill of the palsy
that it shook all over like a leaf. I
thought it was agoing to die; but at
last, thinks I, why shouldn't St Toper
cure she, as he cures so many as have
fits? And so, sir, I goes and fetches
a little water, and flings it on Tabby's
face, and the moment she felt the
water she stops the shaking, and walks
about as well as ever."</p>

<p>"Had she had any breakfast that
morning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, fasting from all but air;
I gave her nothing from the night
before, when she supped on a mouse."</p>

<p>Mr Swallowlies stooped down and
laid his hand on the cat, which was
purring and rubbing its fur against his
leg.</p>

<p>"A strange instance this," he said,
"of the efficacy of the ancient faith."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Why not, sir? I don't attribute
this, of course, to the direct operation
of St Toper; but it certainly was endowed
with this virtue to be evidence
of his holy life. A wonderful animal
this, Mrs Wheedler,&mdash;you would not
probably wish to part with it?"</p>

<p>"I have two or three other cats,
sir; but I'm very poor, and a little
money is more useful to me than old
Tabby."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to you in a little on the
subject. Meanwhile, have you any
other instances of cure?"</p>

<p>"Not to speak of, sir," replied
Janet, delighted with the deference
she was treated with. "That there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">691</span>
little calf as you sees among the cabbage
was born with five legs, and
without ever a tail."</p>

<p>"Five legs! bless me!" exclaimed
Mr Swallowlies&mdash;"how very strange!&mdash;it
has only four now."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir! that's all owing to the
well. I takes it to the spring, and
sprinkles the fifth leg three times, and
immediately it gives a jerk, and up
goes the leg into its body, like the
winding up of a jack-chain; and so I
goes to work again, and flings a
bucketful on its back, and, in a
minute or two, out comes a tail,&mdash;and
there it is, and not a single mark left
of where the additional leg had disappeared."</p>

<p>"This is most interesting!" exclaimed
Mr Swallowlies.  "Have you
got the bucket you used in aspersing
the calf?"</p>

<p>"There it be, sir," said Janet,
pointing to a tub of some size, that
was placed upright against the wall.</p>

<p>"A blessed instrument, indeed,"
said the gentleman, bowing most respectfully,
as he sounded with his
knuckles on the rim. "I must have
some minutes' conversation with you,
Mrs Wheedler, for I make a point of
never taking any stories, which at
first sight appear improbable, without
sedulous inquiry and anxious proof."</p>

<p>"I hear the dinner-bell," I said at
this moment, for I heard Captain
Smith performing the "Roast beef of
Old England" on a key-bugle, which
was the concerted signal for our assembling
where the provender had
been spread; and I used a little more
vigour than usual in drawing the
young ladies away.</p>

<p>"What a splendid specimen of
Anglo-Catholic faith is Mr Swallowlies!"
exclaimed Araminta in a tone
of rapture; "and how free from
bigotry in his reverence for a Romish
saint like the holy Toper!"</p>

<p>"Hold your silly tongue, this moment!"
I exclaimed, getting into a
passion&mdash;"a fellow that believes in
paralytic cats and five-footed calves
being cured by such trumpery, should
leave our church."</p>

<p>"You are so bitter, Mr Buddle,
against the Holy Catholic Church,
that I wonder you call yourself a
Christian at all."</p>

<p>"Where is the Holy Catholic
Church, you little simpleton?" I said,
softening a little, for Araminta is a
nice little girl.</p>

<p>"At Rome, Charles Fustian told
me; and we are but a distant branch
of it, bearing very little fruit, and
owing that little only to the sap furnished
to us by the main old trunk.
And Mr Mount Huxtable says the
same,&mdash;only that our branch bears
no fruit, as the continuity was cut off
at the deplorable Reformation."</p>

<p>"Charles Fustian! Mr Mount
Huxtable!" I cried: "they're laughing
at you, my little dear: they are
both ministers of our church, and
have made numberless protestations
against the wickedness and errors of
Rome. They are laughing at you,&mdash;at
least I know Mount Huxtable is,
for, to tell you a secret, my dear
Araminta, he is placed here for no
other purpose but to defend our Protestant
Establishment against the
Tractarian tendencies of the artists
and young ladies of the day."</p>

<p>"Charles Fustian, sir, I beg to tell
you, knows too well to presume to
laugh at me," said Araminta, tossing
her head.</p>

<p>"He ought, my dear," I replied,
"for he is a remarkably foolish
young man, and hasn't half the sense
in his whole head which you have in
your little finger."</p>

<p>By this time we had reached the
spring; and after placing the girls in
the best seats still to be found, I
called Dr Smiler aside.</p>

<p>"My dear old friend," I said,
"have you made proper inquiry
about Mount Huxtable's church principles,
before you installed him in full
power in the parish?"</p>

<p>"No Tractarian need apply, was
in the advertisement," replied the
Doctor. "He is a stout opponent of
the dissenters; and, besides, my dear
Buddle, as you are the oldest friend
I have in the parish, I may tell you
that on the way here he had a long
conversation with Christina, who sat
beside him in his phaeton, and among
other things he asked her if she
thought she could be content with
the humble condition of a curate's
wife? She said yes, of course,&mdash;for
she has liked him ever since they
met; and he told her he would wait
on me to-morrow. I now consider
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692">692</span>
him my son-in-law. He has great
expectations, and has already fourteen
hundred a-year."</p>

<p>"I don't like what I hear of his
churchmanship," I said. "And as to
Swallowlies, I think he is a bigoted
fool, and a Papist."</p>

<p>"I don't the least see, Mr Buddle,
why a man should be either bigoted
or a fool who believes as two-thirds
of the Christians throughout the
world believe."</p>

<p>So saying, the Doctor turned off in
a very dignified manner, and presided
over the pigeon-pie.</p>

<p>I confess to you, my dear Charles,
this acted like a thunderbolt on me.
Rejoiced as I was at Christina's good
fortune, in attracting the affection of
so amiable and wealthy an admirer
as Mount Huxtable, I did not feel
altogether comfortable at the effect
which this discovery had on the logical
powers of my friend the Rector of
Yawnham. Because a man admires
my daughter, and makes her an offer
of marriage, am I to kiss the Pope's
toe? I made a determination to inquire
into matters more deeply than I
had hitherto done, and, with a view to
pick up all the information I could, I
watched the conversation in silence.</p>

<p>Betsy Blazer sat next Captain
Smith of the Rifles, and, in one of the
pauses which occasionally occur in
the noisiest assemblages, her voice
was distinctly heard.</p>

<p>"Do you ever chant when you are
all together in barracks, Captain
Smith?&mdash;it must be delightful."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't deny that there is
occasionally chanting after mess,"
replied the soldier, a little amazed.</p>

<p>"Who is the leader?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jones and I both pretend
to some renown."</p>

<p>"Are they Gregorian?"</p>

<p>"I should say Stentorian was a
better description, for, between ourselves,
Jones, in the Nottingham Ale,
might be mistaken for an angry
bull."</p>

<p>What the denouement of the conversation
was I don't know, for
Rowdy's voice rose above the din&mdash;</p>

<p>"Faith expires"&mdash;he said&mdash;"hope
grows dim&mdash;but ceremony, the last
refuge of religion, remains. We lose
the trustingness that makes us lay
the promises of holy writ to our
hearts,&mdash;the childlike simplicity that
lifts us into a world where truth erects
her palace on gorgeous clouds, which
to us take the semblance and solidity
of mountains,&mdash;we lose the thrill, the
dread, the love,&mdash;but we can retain
the surplice, the albe, and the stole.
The cloud that seemed a mountain
has disappeared; the confidence that
sustained us has gone,&mdash;but we can
erect churches according to the strictest
rules of architecture, cover the
table with cloth of gold,&mdash;have daily
service, have some fixed, irrevocable,
eternal rule, and feel ourselves the
slaves of hours and postures;&mdash;a
slavery befitting those who are left
to grope in the darkness of their own
souls for a belief, and find nothing to
support, to bless, or cheer them."</p>

<p>"Do you advocate the externals of
devotion, Mr Rowdy, after the reality
of religion has left the heart?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," he said. "If you
waited for the internal religion you
talk of, you would never enter a
church. And pray, sir, what is internal,
and what is external? Your
heart is a piece of flesh, your font is a
piece of stone; why shouldn't holiness
reside in the one as well as in
the other?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Mr Rowdy, to be
rather hypocritical to go through the
forms of religion without the spirit,"
I urged again.</p>

<p>"And what is life but hypocrisy?&mdash;your
very clothes make you a hypocrite:
without them you would resemble
a forked radish, but you disfigure
yourself in surtout and pantaloons.
Go through the ceremonies,
sir&mdash;the feeling in time will come;
dig your trenches deep, and the rain
will pour into them and burn the
sacrifice of your altar with fire; kneel
when you have no devotion, bend
yourself to decrees and ordinances
when you have no humility and no
faith; and, entering on that course
with the scoff of Voltaire, you will
emerge from it with the sanctity of
Vincent de Paul."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, sir, I maintain,"
said I, "that, if you persist in these
miserable bonds of an outward obedience,
in the expectation that they
will promote your advance in goodness,
you bring on yourself the condemnation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">693</span>
of the Pharisee; you may
enter them with the faith of your
friend Mr Swallowlies, but you will
leave them ere long with the sentiments
of the infidel and apostate
Strauss."</p>

<p>"I call no man an apostate," cried
Mr Rowdy, "who traces the operations
of his own mind to their legitimate
results; I call no man an infidel
who believes that he was born, and
that he shall die."</p>

<p>"How good! how liberal! how
humane!" exclaimed a chorus of
sweet voices.</p>

<p>"And what do <span class="smcap">YOU</span> say?" I enquired,
addressing our new curate.</p>

<p>"For myself," said Mr Mount
Huxtable, "I think it sinful in any one
to decide on such a subject, unless in
the exact words of the church."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the Doctor;
"judiciously answered."</p>

<p>"Don't you allow private judgment,
sir?" said I.</p>

<p>"No more, sir," he replied, "than
I should allow private execution. It is
for the church to pass sentence: if
any presumptuous individual interferes
with her authority, he is as much
out of his sphere as if he were to displace
Baron Alderson on the bench,
go through the mockery of a trial,
and condemn an enemy of his own to
be hanged."</p>

<p>"Very good, indeed," said the
Doctor; "judiciously answered."</p>

<p>"I have often heard your friend,
Charles Fustian, say the same," said
Araminta.</p>

<p>"Is he a friend of yours, Mount
Huxtable?" inquired Dr Smiler, in a
very bland tone.</p>

<p>"A most intimate friend, my dear
sir," replied Mount Huxtable.</p>

<p>"Dear me!&mdash;I thought you told me
you didn't know him."</p>

<p>"No, my dear sir, I didn't tell you
so: I only gave you to understand
that we weren't acquainted."</p>

<p>"That used to be pretty much the
same thing," I said, a little chafed
with the putting down I had already
experienced, "and I suspect you are
a great deal more intimate than you
were inclined to let us know."</p>

<p>"You have exactly hit upon the
reason," he replied. "I was not inclined
to let you know; and I have
yet to learn that a priest is imperatively
required to confess to a layman,
however inquisitive or ill-mannered he
may be."</p>

<p>"Come, my dear Buddle," said the
Doctor, "I think you will see that
you ought to apologise."</p>

<p>"For what?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"For speaking so irreverently to
the pastor of the parish," replied Dr
Smiler. "You should consider, sir,
that Mr Mount Huxtable is your spiritual
guide."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Araminta; and
Christina Smiler grew first red and
then pale, and looked at me as if I
were a heathen.</p>

<p>I sipped a glass in silence; and the
altercation had the unpleasant effect
of producing an awkward pause.</p>

<p>When the silence had endured for
upwards of a minute, it was suddenly
broken by Major M'Turk ejaculating,
in his most military manner, "Sharpshooters,
to the front!" and mechanically
Jones and Smith sprang up, and,
advancing a few paces, anxiously
looked upward in the direction pointed
out by the commander's hand.
The sight they saw might have shaken
less firm nerves than theirs; for, toiling
slowly down the hill, from Janet
Wheedler's cottage, we perceived a
nondescript figure, yet evidently human,
more puzzling than the sea-serpent.
Some large round substance
enveloped its head, and entirely buried
the hat and face, and covered the
whole of the neck down to the middle
buttons of the coat. Tucked under
one arm we beheld a cat, secured by a
ribbon tied round its neck; and, with
a large kitchen poker in the other
hand, the advancing stranger drove
before him a great awkward calf.
When he got a little nearer, we recognised
our friend Mr Swallowlies.</p>

<p>"In heaven's name!" exclaimed
the Rector, "what have you got
there, Mr Swallowlies?"</p>

<p>"It is in heaven's name, indeed,"
replied Swallowlies, lifting up the
large washing-tub which we had seen
in Janet's cottage. "These, sir, are
holy relies, which I have luckily induced
the venerable matron of the hut
to part with&mdash;partly by prayers and
supplications, and partly by payments
in money."</p>

<p>The Rector looked astonished, for
he had not been of our party; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">694</span>
Swallowlies, allowing the calf to feed
on the grass near the spring, explained
his sentiments on the subject of the
tub, and related the miraculous history
of the animals his companions.</p>

<p>"And how much did you give for
the tub, sir?" said Smiler.</p>

<p>"Five pounds procured the inestimable
treasure," answered Swallowlies
in triumph; "eight pounds procured
me the sacred tabby, and twelve
guineas the calf. A very few pounds
more have obtained for me, if possible,
still more precious articles. Look
here, sir," he continued, pulling from
his coat-pocket an old quarter-boot,
with the sole nearly off, and two or
three flat-headed nails sticking out
from the tattered heel&mdash;"this is one of
the sandals in which the illustrious
Toper used to go his annual pilgrimage
to the shrine of St Thomas of Canterbury.
This instrument of iron&mdash;which,
I confess, struck me at first to
bear a great resemblance to a poker&mdash;was
his staff. And this, sir," he said,
pulling from his bosom a piece of very
old corduroy, mended in several
places&mdash;"this is the left leg of the
pantaloons the saint wore for upwards
of forty years, without ever taking
them off; for he is recorded never to
have changed his raiment but twice,
and never to have washed either his
face or hands,&mdash;such a true Christian
soldier was he."</p>

<p>"He was a dirty brute, and no soldier,"
cried Captain Smith, who was
a great martinet in his regiment,
"and I would have had him flogged
every morning till he learned to be
more tidy."</p>

<p>"Sacrilege! horror!" exclaimed
Swallowlies, crossing himself in the
greatest perturbation, and placing the
tub once more on his head, and resuming
his labours in driving the calf
onward with his poker.</p>

<p>"Won't you have some pie?" said
Dr Smiler.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am fasting to-day, and
am anxious to place my treasures in
security."</p>

<p>"Such faith is highly edifying,"
said Mount Huxtable, "and unfortunately
too uncommon in the present
day. Ah! were all men equally pure,
and as highly gifted as Swallowlies,
the Reformation would soon be blotted
out, and our Mother of Rome receive
her repentant children."</p>

<p>"How? What did you say, my
dear sir?" inquired the Rector. "Are
you not a Protestant?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not, sir. I detest the
cold and barren name. It is a mere
negation. I want something positive.
It is the part of a Christian to believe&mdash;certainly
not to deny."</p>

<p>"To be sure, Doctor, we are none of
us Protestants; we are Anglo-Catholics,"
said Araminta, answering for
the feminine part of his flock.</p>

<p>"I never viewed it in that light before,"
said Dr Smiler, looking assuringly
at Christina, who seemed greatly
alarmed at what her father might do.
"Certainly religion is not a mere
denial of error; it is far more&mdash;an
embracing of truth."</p>

<p>"There is no truth omitted in the
faith of the Catholic Church," said
Mount Huxtable solemnly. "Some
are more developed than they were at
first; and some, more recently planted,
are even now in course of growth,
and, before many years elapse, will infallibly
spread their branches all over
this barren land. But I will call on
you to-morrow," he added, with a
smile, and a bend of his head towards
Christina, which entirely barred up
all the arguments that our Protestant
champion might have been inclined to
advance. And in a short time the pic-nic
came to an end, and we all returned
to Yawnham in the order we
had come&mdash;always excepting Mr Swallowlies,
whom we overtook in the first
half-mile, still under his umbrageous
sombrero, and still gesticulating with
the poker to guide his erratic calf.</p>

<h3 id="LETTER_FOURTH">LETTER FOURTH.</h3>

<p>I had not sealed up the letter which
I inclose to you herewith, my dear
Charles, and fortunately, as it turns
out&mdash;for I have it now in my power
to tell you the conclusion of your
machinations in this parish.</p>

<p>Three weeks have elapsed since the
expedition to Holywell Tree. My
anger, I confess, with Dr Smiler was
so hot that I never called at the parsonage;
and after the first Sunday I
did not even go to church. The communion-table
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">695</span>
is now surmounted by a
gigantic crucifix&mdash;a cover of bright
velvet, with a golden star in the
centre, hangs down to the ground,
while a vase of flowers stands on the
middle of the table, flanked at each
side by immense candlesticks, with a
candle of two or three pounds' weight
in each. There is a stone creding
table, an eagle at one side of the
aisle in bronze, and the old recess in
the porch is cleared out, and a basin
placed in it; but whether for the reception
of holy water or charitable
pence I did not stop to inquire. There
is daily service at ten in the morning.
The girls wear a regular uniform, and
call themselves Sisters of the Order of
St Cecilia, and have appointed Swallowlies
their father confessor; and
once or twice a-week, I believe, he, or
Rowdy, or Mount Huxtable, attends
in the vestry, and takes the young
ladies, one by one, to a solitary conversation,
with the door locked. And
the best of the affair is, that Tom
Blazer and his two military friends
are as constant in their attendance as
the rest. But, with these exceptions,
there is not a man to be seen in the
church, either on week-days or Sundays;
for I am told that even John
Simpkins and Peter Bolt have struck
for wages, and won't attend prayers
under half-a-crown a-week. So we
have begun a subscription in the parish
for a district chapel; and in the
mean time we stream off by the hundred,
either to the church or meeting-houses
of the nearest parish. Major
M'Turk, I am sorry to say, has had
many interviews with the Reverend Mr
Rowdy, and has become almost an infidel,
with a leaning, if anything, to
the religion of the Buddhists in India,
who fast, he says, fifty times more,
and go through a thousand times
more painful penances than either
Puseyite or Papist.</p>

<p>This morning I was surprised to see
Doctor Smiler coming up my garden
walk, as he used to do in the days of
our friendship. He looked rather
downcast as he drew near the window,
where I was busy getting my
fishing-flies in order, and coughed
once or twice, as if to announce his
approach. I pretended not to hear
him, and continued absorbed in my
lines and feathers; and, instead of
coming in at the open door as he has
done for the last twenty years, he
actually rang the bell, and old Thomas
had to bustle on his coat, and come
out of the back-yard to see who was
there,&mdash;and I thought the old man's
tone was a little sharp when he announced
Dr Smiler.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Doctor Smiler?"
I said very courteously; "have the
kindness to be seated."</p>

<p>The Doctor sat down.</p>

<p>"Are you going to the brook to-day?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes; if the wind holds, I shall
try it for an hour or two this evening.
I hope Mrs Smiler is well."</p>

<p>"She is not well," he said.</p>

<p>"And Christina&mdash;Miss Christina?"
I added, correcting myself.</p>

<p>"Dying," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Christina dying!" I exclaimed,
starting up and taking the Doctor's
hand; "my dear Smiler, why didn't you
tell us?&mdash;why didn't you send for us?"</p>

<p>"I was ashamed, and that's the
truth," said the Doctor. "Ah!
Buddle, you were wiser than I."</p>

<p>"How?&mdash;what? Is it that rascal
Mount Huxtable?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," replied Smiler.
"He has ruined the happiness of my
daughter, turned away the hearts of
my parishioners, and made me a
laughing-stock to the whole county."</p>

<p>"Is he not going to marry her,
then?&mdash;did he not call on you after the
pic-nic?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't call on me; but he
consulted Christina's taste in all
things&mdash;got her to superintend the
alterations in the church&mdash;the candlesticks
and flowers; he even asked
her what style of paper she liked for
drawing rooms, and the poor girl
expected every moment that he would
make a formal demand."</p>

<p>"It may come yet," I said, endeavouring
to cheer him.</p>

<p>"It can't, my dear friend. I find
he is married already."</p>

<p>"The villain!"</p>

<p>"He was an intimate friend of
Charles Fustian," continued the Rector,
"and by his advice answered my
advertisement for an anti-Tractarian
curate; by his advice also he concealed
the fact of his marriage, and,
in the course of less than a month,
see what he has done."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">696</span></p>

<p>"He denied that he knew Charles
Fustian."</p>

<p>"I accused him of the duplicity
this morning, but he says it was for
the good of the flock; and as he is
their shepherd for two years, he has a
greater interest in them than I."</p>

<p>"And how did he explain his
speeches to Christina?"</p>

<p>"General observations," he says;
"he wished her opinion on drawing-room
papers, and required her assistance
in the interior arrangement of
his church."</p>

<p>"His church! the puppy! We
shall petition the bishop."</p>

<p>"Of no use," said the Rector.
"You will perceive, my dear Buddle,
that the generality of the bench are
either very fond of power, and flattered
with Puseyite sycophancy; or
anxious to keep pace with the titled
aristocracy, and very fond of 'gentility.'
Now there is no denying that
the Tractarians are more polished
men, and, as far as the arts and refinements
go, more cultivated men than
the labouring clergy generally, and
therefore these two things keep them
secure from any authoritative condemnation&mdash;their
truckling to their
spiritual superiors, and their standing
in society. If Mount Huxtable had
been a vulgar fellow, though with the
energy and holiness of St Paul,&mdash;if he
had stood up against his diocesan
and vindicated his liberty, either of
speech or action, in the slightest degree&mdash;we
could have hurled him from
the parish, probably into gaol, in
spite of all the licenses in the world;
but I have no hope in this case."</p>

<p>"Then I have," I said, "for, from
what you told me of the fellow's hypocrisy,
I have no doubt he was the very
man who was received, as they call it,
into the Romish Church by Bishop
Cunningham, three months since."</p>

<p>"It is surely impossible, my dear
Buddle; how could he officiate in our
church after being a professed papist?"</p>

<p>"Easily, my dear Smiler; it has
very often been done, and is frequently
done at this moment. Take that account
of the ceremony with you, and
tax him with it at once."</p>

<p>The Doctor folded up the paper, and
went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But this is not all. How am I to
atone to poor Mrs Blazer, and poor
Mrs Swainlove, for what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Why?&mdash;what has happened to the
old ladies?"</p>

<p>"Jones has eloped with Araminta
Blazer; and, in the same post-chaise,
Smith has carried off Tinderella Swainlove!"</p>

<p>"Why, they were almost professed
unbelievers,&mdash;at least not at all Tractarian."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter. They are
off, and what we have now to hope for
is&mdash;that they will go to Gretna Green.
Young Pulser also has kicked Mr
Rowdy into the mill-pond, where he
was nearly drowned, for something or
other he said or did to Priscilla Pulser
at confession; and, to complete the
catalogue of woes, Mr Swallowlies has
been arrested for theft; for it appears
that the calf which Janet Wheedler
sold him was not her own, but belonged
to farmer Ruffhead."</p>

<p>What could I say to comfort the
poor old rector under such a tremendous
cloud of calamity? The solitary
glimpse of satisfaction, I confess,
which I individually caught from his
narrative was, that Araminta had
shown the good taste to leave a friend
of mine in the lurch. I will add nothing
to this letter, for I am hurrying
off to assist the Doctor in comforting
his household, and recovering possession
of his parish. How we succeed
in this, and what steps we take to regain
the confidence and affection of
the flock, I shall not fail to inform you.
Meanwhile, reflect on all that has
arisen from your introduction of these
foreign mummeries and superstitions
into this quiet parish, and "how great
effects from little causes spring."&mdash;</p>

<p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2 id="AUSTRIA_AND_HUNGARY">AUSTRIA AND HUNGARY.</h2>

<p>When Jellachich, on the 9th September
1848, passed the Drave, the
boundary of Croatia and of Hungary
Proper, the war between Austria and
Hungary may be said to have commenced.
Up to that time the hostilities
directed against Hungary had
been confined to the attacks of her
revolted Sclavonic subjects in some
parts of Croatia, and in the counties
on the Lower Danube. These revolts
had been instigated, and the attacks
conducted, by officers in the Austrian
service, who were countenanced and
aided by a party at the court, and
who asserted that they acted with the
authority and in the interests of the
Imperial family. Still the emperor,
on the demand of the Hungarian ministry,
had disavowed their proceedings.
In May, he had publicly degraded
Jellachich from all his offices,
as a rebel against the Hungarian
government. In July, he had formally
announced to the diet, through his
representative the Archduke Palatine,
his determination to maintain the integrity
of Hungary, and the laws he
had sanctioned in April, and repudiated,
as a calumny, the assertion
of Jellachich and the other leaders
of the revolt, that the emperor, or
any other member of the Imperial
family, countenanced their proceedings.
It is true that Jellachich and
another of these leaders had subsequently
been received by the emperor-king,
and by several members of the
Imperial family, in a manner hardly
consistent with their position as rebels;
yet it was possible that his majesty
might still listen to other counsels&mdash;might
still resolve to pursue a constitutional
course, and to preserve his
own faith inviolate. Even so late as
the 9th September&mdash;the day on which
Jellachich passed the Drave&mdash;he solemnly
renewed his promise to maintain
the integrity of Hungary and the
laws of April. But upon the 4th September
he had reinstated Jellachich
in all his offices, civil and military,
knowing that he was then at the head
of an army on the frontiers of Hungary,
preparing to invade that kingdom,
and to force the Hungarians to
renounce the concessions made to them
in April by their king. It appeared
that the Ban had been supplied with
money and with arms from Vienna
while he was still nominally in disgrace,
and he was joined by Austrian
regiments, which had marched from
Southern Hungary to put themselves
under his orders. His advance, therefore,
at the head of an army composed
of Austrian regiments and Croat forces,
was truly an invasion of Hungary by
Austria.</p>

<p>The Hungarian forces collected to
resist this invasion were still without
a commander-in-chief or a staff&mdash;without
sufficient arms or ammunition,
and for the most part without
military discipline or organisation.
We have already mentioned that, on
the restoration of the Ban to his offices
and command, the Hungarian ministry
resigned; but Mazaros, minister
of the war department, Kossuth, minister
of finance, and Szemere, minister
of the interior, continued provisionally
to perform the duties of their
offices. Their measures were so energetic,
that the Palatine called upon
Count Louis Bathyanyi, the head of
the late ministry, to form another
government. This step was approved
at Vienna; and Bathyanyi undertook
the duty on the condition that Jellachich
should be ordered to retire,
and, if he refused, should be proclaimed
a traitor. The king required
a list of the proposed ministry, which
was immediately presented; but a
week or more elapsed, during which
no answer was received, and during
which Jellachich continued to advance
towards the capital of Hungary. The
Palatine, at the request of the diet,
and after the measure had been approved
by the king, took command of
the Hungarian troops opposed to the
Ban, which were then retiring upon
Buda. Both parties, the invaders
and the invaded, appeared at this
time to be countenanced by the
Emperor of Austria and King of
Hungary; and the diet, while preparing
for defence, seems not to have
relinquished all hope of a peaceful
arrangement. The Archduke Stephen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">698</span>
after joining the army, and hastily
organising it, opened communications
with the Ban, and arranged a meeting
in boats on the Lake Balaton: but
Jellachich did not keep his appointment;
and the Archduke Palatine,
summoned to Vienna by the emperor,
left the army, passed through Pesth
on his way to Vienna, and on his
arrival there, as we formerly stated,
resigned the office of palatine. Shortly
afterwards he retired to his private
residence on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Count Louis Bathyanyi, whose conditions
had not yet been either accepted
or rejected, was thus left alone
to carry on the whole government;
and the diet, for the purposes both of
aiding and controlling the administration
of the minister, named a committee
of their number, called the
"Committee of Defence," to assist in
conducting the government.</p>

<p>Jellachich had now established himself
at Stuhlweissenberg, four or five
marches from Pesth; and the government
at Vienna appears to have anticipated
that Hungary, left without a
government, must fall into confusion.
But she preserved her loyal and constitutional
attitude; and while she was
prepared to repel force by force, gave
no pretext for employing it. Count
L. Bathyanyi was at length informed
that his list of the new ministry was
not approved; and by an ordinance
dated 25th September, General Count
Francis Lamberg was appointed to
the command of all the troops in Hungary,
with power to restore order and
to close the diet. The time had arrived
which the Hungarians had been most
desirous to avert, when they must
either surrender their constitutional
rights or resist their king.</p>

<p>The murder of Count Lamberg by
a frantic mob threw the diet into a
state of consternation. The regiment
on which it most relied was the regiment
of Lamberg, and the Ban was at
the gates of Buda. The diet passed
resolutions expressing its profound
grief at the unhappy fate of the count,
and ordered criminal proceedings to
be immediately instituted against his
murderers. The patriotism of the
soldiers was not shaken by the horrible
event that had occurred; and they displayed
their wonted gallantry on the
29th, when the Ban was repulsed. Immediately
after the murder of General
Lamberg, Count Louis Bathyanyi resigned.
There was now neither palatine
nor minister in the kingdom, and the
enemy was about to attack the capital.
In this emergency the Committee
of Defence, at the head of which was
Louis Kossuth, took upon itself the
direction of affairs; and since that time
it has governed Hungary.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Jellachich, while
he was on the frontiers of Austria,
followed by the Hungarian army, the
king named Count Adam Ricsay prime-minister,
and by a new ordinance, countersigned
Ricsay, the diet was dissolved,
its decrees annulled, and Jellachich
appointed commander-in-chief of all
the troops in Hungary. The civil authorities
were suspended, and the country
declared in a state of siege. At the
same time Jellachich was named royal
commissioner, and invested with executive
power over the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>From the moment of Jellachich's
nomination to the office of Ban of
Croatia, without the consent of the
responsible Hungarian ministry, his
concert with a party hostile to Hungary
at the imperial court had not
been doubtful; and that party had
now prevailed upon the emperor-king
to adopt their views. The influence
of the Ban was not shaken by his
defeat. The court had previously
identified itself with his proceedings,
and he had faithfully, though not
hitherto successfully, espoused its
cause. He had declared against the
laws of April and the separate ministry
in Hungary, which these laws had
established, and in favour of a central
government at Vienna for the whole
dominions of the emperor, which he
proposed to force the Hungarians to
accept. He was no longer a Croat
chief, asserting the national pretensions
of his countrymen, but an Austrian
general, assailing the constitution
and the independence of Hungary.
From the position at Raab, on the
road to Vienna, to which he had retreated
after his reverse, he applied
for reinforcements to enable him again
to advance towards Pesth. It was the
refusal of these reinforcements to
march that led to the second revolution
at Vienna, which has been attributed
to Hungarian agency. It is
probable that the Hungarians would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">699</span>
employ all the influence they could
command to prevent or impede the
march of troops to attack them; but
it is remarkable that the prosecutions
of persons engaged in that revolution
do not appear to have elicited anything
that would justify us in attributing
the revolt of the Viennese to
the Hungarians. Attempts have also
been made to implicate the Hungarians
in the atrocious murder of Latour,
the minister of war, by the insurgents
of Vienna, but we have not
been able to trace any foundation for
such a charge. The Hungarians were
formidable enemies, and to them every
atrocity was attributed.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria was now
at war with Hungary, and his enemies,
therefore, became her allies.
The revolutionary party at Vienna
for a time regained the ascendency,
and signalised it by the crime to
which we have referred. After Windischgratz
and Jellachich had invested
the city, the Viennese applied to the
Hungarians for aid; but their levies
and national guards had returned in
great numbers to their homes, and
their army was not in a condition to
make any impression upon that of the
emperor. It advanced, and was repulsed.
The Austrian government,
by allying itself with rebellion and
anarchy to subvert the established
constitution of Hungary, had driven
the Hungarians, in self-defence, into
an alliance with the revolutionary
party in Vienna against the government.</p>

<p>The error into which it had been
led ought now to have been manifest
to the Austrian cabinet; and it was
not yet too late to remedy the evil.
By returning to the course of legality
and good faith, the Imperial government
might have disarmed and regained
Hungary. If there was in
that country, as there no doubt was,
a party which was disposed to sympathise
with the republicans, and
even with the worst of the anarchists
in Austria, they were without power
or influence, and their evil designs
would at once have been frustrated,
their opinions repudiated, and the
loyalty of the nation confirmed; but
the court had unfortunately placed
itself in a position that left it but the
choice of abandoning and breaking
faith with the rebels to Hungary,
whose eminent services at Vienna it
was bound to acknowledge, or of persevering
in the breach of faith with
Hungary, which his advisers had
forced upon the emperor-king. That
the Hungarians had been ready to
support the cause of monarchy and
order, so long as faith had been kept
with them, was put beyond all question
by the vote of the diet, which,
on the motion of the responsible Hungarian
ministry formed in April, had
placed forty thousand Hungarian
troops at the disposal of the emperor,
for service in Italy, "to preserve the
honour of the Austrian arms," then
endangered by the first reverses of
Marshal Radetski. The Wessemberg
ministry appears to have contemplated
restoring the king of Hungary
and his subjects to their legal and
constitutional relations, for it issued
a circular declaring that the king intended
to fulfil the engagements he
had entered into in April. But the
power of the minister was subordinate
to that of a party at the court, whose
views were opposed to his own; and
the acts of the government were not
such as to restore confidence in its
sincerity, at all times a difficult task
for a government that has justly forfeited
the confidence of a whole nation.
Hungary did not dare to suspend
her preparations for resistance;
and the second revolution at Vienna,
by occupying the troops destined to
attack her, gave her time to improve
her means of defence.</p>

<p>Had there been at Vienna a government
capable of inspiring confidence
in its sincerity&mdash;a government possessing
power or influence enough to
carry out conciliatory measures, to
fulfil the engagements it might contract&mdash;the
differences between Austria
and Hungary might still have been
amicably adjusted, by restoring the
constitutional government established
in April. All the bloodshed and
misery that has ensued, and all the
evils that may yet follow from the
war, would thus have been averted.
But irresponsible advisers had more
influence at the court than the ostensible
cabinet, and were blindly bent
on returning to the irretrievable past.
They founded their hopes upon the
devotion of that noble army which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">700</span>
had re-established order in Austria,
and which, if employed only to maintain
order and the just rights of the
monarchy, would have encountered
no opposition that it could not overcome.
Hungary, cordially reunited to
Austria under the same sovereign,
would again have become, what the
Emperor Francis declared it to be,
"the chief bulwark of the monarchy;"
and the empire would have resumed
its position as the guardian of peace
and order in Eastern Europe, and a
powerful support to the cause of
constitutional monarchy and rational
liberty everywhere.</p>

<p>Unhappily for the Austrian empire,
for Europe, and for "the good cause,"
evil counsels prevailed, and Hungary
was again invaded. Many of the
leading magnates adhered to the court,
at which they had spent their lives,
and which was in fact their home.
But there was hardly a great family
of which some wealthy and influential
members did not declare for their native
country. A great majority of the resident
aristocracy&mdash;the numerous class
of resident country gentlemen, almost
without exception&mdash;the body of inferior
nobles or freeholders&mdash;the peasant-proprietors
and the labouring population,
espoused the cause of Hungary.
The Protestant clergy in the Majjar
country, to a man, and the Roman
Catholic clergy of Hungary in a body,
urged their flocks to be patient and
orderly, to obey the government charged
with the defence of the country, and
to be faithful and valiant in defending
it.</p>

<p>The attacks of Jellachich, and of that
portion of the Croats and Serbes
which had declared against Hungary,
had failed to bring about the submission
of the diet, and had produced an
alliance, dangerous to the court, between
its enemies in the Hereditary
States and the Hungarians, with whom
it was now at war. The national
assembly or congress that met at
Vienna was tainted with republican
notions, and divided into factions, influenced
for the most part by feelings
of race. German unity, Sclave ascendency,
and Polish regeneration,
were the ultimate objects of many of
those who talked of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. The discussion of
the constitution revealed the discord
in their opinions, and they seemed to
agree in nothing but the determination
to overturn the ancient system of
the empire.</p>

<p>Wearied by contentions, in which
his character and feelings unfitted
him to take a part; distracted by
diverse counsels; involved by a series
of intrigues, from which he could not
escape, in conflicting engagements;
dreading the new order of things, and
diffident of his own ability to perform
the duties it demanded of him, the
Emperor Ferdinand abdicated; and
by a family arrangement the crown
of Austria was transferred, not to the
next heir, but to the second in succession.
The crown of Hungary, as we
formerly stated, had been settled by
statute on the heirs of the House of
Hapsburg; but no provision had
been made for the case which had
now arisen. The Hungarians held
that their king had no power to abdicate;
that so long as he lived he
must continue to be their king; that
if he became incapable of performing
the regal functions, the laws had
reserved to the diet the power to
provide for their due performance;
that the crown of Hungary was
settled by statute on the heirs of the
House of Hapsburg, and the Emperor
Francis Joseph was not the heir.
The laws of Hungary required that
her king should be legitimately
crowned according to the ancient
customs of the kingdom, and should
take the coronation oath before he
could exercise his rights or authority
as sovereign. If he claimed the
crown of Hungary as his legal right,
he was bound to abide by the laws
on which that right was founded.
But these laws required that he should
be crowned according to the customs
of Hungary, and that he should bind
himself by a solemn oath to maintain
the constitution and the laws, including
those passed in March, sanctioned
and put into operation in April 1848.
In short, that he should concede what
Hungary was contending for.</p>

<p>The abdication of the Emperor
Ferdinand, and the accession to the
Imperial throne of his youthful successor,
presented another opportunity
of which the Austrian government
might have gracefully availed itself,
to terminate the differences with

Hungary. The young emperor was
fettered by no engagements, involved
in none of the intrigues that entangled
his unwary predecessor, and entailed
so great evils upon the country. He
was free to take a constitutional
course in Hungary, to confirm the
concessions which had been voluntarily
made, and which could not
now be recalled&mdash;to restore to the
Imperial government a character for
good faith; and thus to have won the
hearts of the Hungarians. Supported
by their loyal attachment to their king,
he might have peacefully worked out
the reforms in the government of his
empire which the times and the circumstances
demanded or justified.
But Count Stadion, the real head of
the new ministry, though possessed of
many eminent qualities as a statesman,
was deeply imbued with the
old longing after unity in the system
of government: he hoped to effect, by
means of a constitution devised and
framed for that purpose, the amalgamation
of the different parts of the
empire, which abler men had failed to
accomplish under an absolute monarchy,
in circumstances more favourable
to success. The opposition that
was inevitable in Hungary he proposed
to overcome by force of arms;
and, at a moment when a desire for
separate nationality was the predominant
feeling in the minds of all the
different races in the empire, he had
the hardihood to imagine that he
could frame a constitution capable
of overcoming this desire, and of
fusing them all into one. It was
considered an advantage that the emperor,
unfettered by personal engagements
to Hungary, was free to prosecute
its subjugation, to subvert its
constitution, and to force the Hungarians
to accept in its place the constitution
of Count Stadion, with seats
in the Assembly at Vienna for their
representatives, under one central government
for the united empire. This
may have been a desirable result to
obtain; it might, if attainable, have
been ultimately conducive to the
strength of the empire and the welfare
of all classes; but it was not to
claim the hereditary succession to a
throne secured and guarded by statutes&mdash;it
was rather to undertake the
conquest of a kingdom.</p>

<p>Windischgratz and Jellachich occupied
Pesth without opposition, set
aside the constituted authorities, and
governed the country, as far as their
army extended, by martial law. The
Committee of Defence retired beyond
the Theis to Debreczin, in the heart
of the Majjar country, and appealed
to the patriotism of the Hungarians.
The army was rapidly recruited, and
was organised in the field, for the campaign
may be said to have endured
throughout the whole winter. From
time to time it was announced from
Vienna that the war was about to be
terminated by the advance of the imperial
army, and the dispersion or
destruction of <i>Kossuth's faction</i>. The
flight of Kossuth, and his capture as a
fugitive in disguise, were reported and
believed. The delay in the advance
of the imperial army was attributed to
the rigour of the season and the state
of the roads; and, when these impediments
no longer existed, to the incapacity
of Windischgratz, who was
roughly handled by the government
press of Vienna. The true cause was
carefully concealed. The resistance
was not that of a faction, but of a
nation. That fact has been fully
established by the events in this unfortunate,
unnecessary, and unnatural
war.</p>

<p>The Austrian armies employed in
Hungary have probably exceeded one
hundred and fifty thousand regular
troops, aided by irregular bands of
Croats and Serbes, and latterly by a
Russian corps of ten thousand men.
They established themselves both in
Transylvania and in Hungary, and were
in possession of the whole of the fertile
country from the frontiers of
Austria to the Theis, which flows
through the centre of the kingdom.
From Transylvania, both the Austrian
and the Russian forces have been
driven into Wallachia. From the line
of the Theis the imperial army has been
forced across the Danube, on which
they were unable to maintain their
positions. The sieges of Komorn and
Peterwardein, the two great fortresses
on the Danube, of which the capture
or surrender has so often been announced,
have been raised; and the
question is no longer whether Debreczin
is to be occupied by the
Emperor's forces, but whether Vienna
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">702</span>
is safe from the Hungarians. Opposed
to the admirable army of Austria,
these results could not have been obtained
unless the great body of the
nation had been cordially united, nor
even then, unless by a people of great
energy, courage, and intelligence.</p>

<p>Had the government of Austria
known how to win the hearts of the
Hungarians for their sovereign&mdash;had
they but preserved the good faith and
the sanctity of the monarchy in Hungary,
how secure and imposing might
the position of the Emperor have now
been, in the midst of all the troubles
in Germany!  Hungary desired no
revolution; she had peacefully obtained,
by constitutional means, all she desired.
Her revolution had been
effected centuries ago; and, with indigenous
institutions, to which her
people were warmly attached, she
would have maintained, as she did
maintain, her internal tranquillity and
her constitutional monarchy, whatever
storms might rage around her.</p>

<p>The resources that Hungary has put
forth in this contest have surprised
Europe, because Europe had not taken
the trouble to calculate the strength
and the resources of Hungary. With
a compact territory, equal in extent
to Great Britain and Ireland, or to
Prussia, and the most defensible frontier
of any kingdom on the continent
of Europe; with a population nearly
equal to that of England, and not
much inferior to that of Prussia;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
with a climate equal to that of France,
and soil of greater natural fertility
than any of these; with a representative
government long established, and
free indigenous institutions, which the
people venerate; with a brave, energetic,
and patriotic population, predisposed
to military pursuits, jealous
of their national independence, and of
their personal liberty&mdash;ambitious of
military renown, proud of their traditionary
prowess, and impressed with
an idea of their own superiority to the
surrounding populations&mdash;Hungary,
as all who know the country and the
people were aware, would be found a
formidable antagonist by any power
that might attack her. But, paradoxical
and incredible as it may appear,
we believe it is not the less true, that,
little as Hungary was known in most
of the countries of Europe, there was
hardly a capital, in that quarter of the
globe, where more erroneous notions
regarding it prevailed than in Vienna.
In other places there was ignorance;
in the capital of Austria there was the
most absurd misapprehension. Though
generally a calm, sensible man, possessing
a considerable amount of general
information, an Austrian, even
after he has travelled, appears to be
peculiarly incapable of understanding
a national character different from his
own: this is true even in respect to
other Germans; and neither the proximity
of the countries, nor the frequent
intercourse of their inhabitants, seems
to have enabled him to form any reasonable
estimate of the Hungarian
character or institutions. We might
adduce curious evidence of this ignorance,
even in persons of distinction;
but we shall content ourselves with
quoting Mr Paget's observations on
the subject, in June 1835:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The reader would certainly laugh, as
I have often done since, did I tell him one
half of the foolish tales the good Viennese
told us of the country we were about to
visit&mdash;no roads! no inns! no police! We
must sleep on the ground, eat where we
could, and be ready to defend our purses
and our lives at every moment. In full
credence of these reports, we provided
ourselves most plentifully with arms,
which were carefully loaded, and placed
ready for immediate use....
It may, however, ease the reader's mind
to know, that no occasion to shoot anything
more formidable than a partridge or
a hare presented itself, and that we
finished our journey with the full conviction,
that travelling in Hungary was just
as safe as travelling in England.</p>

<p>Why, or wherefore, I know not, but
nothing can exceed the horror with which
a true Austrian regards both Hungary
and its inhabitants. I have sometimes
suspected that the bugbear with which a
Vienna mother frightens her squaller to
sleep must be an Hungarian bugbear;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">703</span>
for in no other way can I account for the
inbred and absurd fear which they entertain
for such near neighbours. It is true,
the Hungarians do sometimes talk about
liberty, constitutional rights, and other
such terrible things, to which no well-disposed
ears should be open, and to
which the ears of the Viennese are religiously
closed."</p></blockquote>

<p>There were, no doubt, elements of
discord in Hungary, of which Austria,
on former occasions as well as
now, took advantage; but their value
to her in the present war has been
greatly overrated. The population of
the kingdom, like that of the empire,
is composed of various races, amongst
which there are differences of language,
religion, customs, and sentiments.
Of the 14,000,000 of people
who inhabit Hungary, not more
than 5,000,000 are Majjars, about
1,262,000 are Germans, 2,311,000
Wallacks, and, of the remaining
5,400,000, nine-tenths or more are
Sclaves. The Sclaves are therefore
as numerous as the Majjars; and,
although these races had at all times
combined against foreign enemies, it
was probable that they would not
unite in a domestic quarrel, as that
with Austria might be considered.
When a great part of the colonists of
the military frontier, chiefly Croats and
Serbes, took part against the government
of Hungary, and asserted a
Sclave nationality as opposed to the
Hungarian nationality, it was too
hastily assumed, by persons imperfectly
informed, that the whole Sclavonic
population, equalling the Majjars
in number, would be available to
Austria in the war. But the Sclaves
of Hungary are a disunited race,
divided into nine different tribes, the
greater part of which have nothing
in common except their origin. Most
of these tribes speak languages or
dialects which are mutually unintelligible;
and the Sclaves of different
tribes are sometimes obliged to use
the Majjar tongue as their only means
of communication. Some belong to
the Roman Catholic Church, some to
the Greek; others are Protestants&mdash;Lutheran
or Calvinist: and some,
while they have submitted to the see
of Rome, retain many of their Greek
forms and services, adhere to the Greek
calendar, and constitute a distinct
communion. The Slovacks of Northern
Hungary, numbering 1,600,000,
are partly Roman Catholics, partly
Protestants&mdash;and have no intercourse
or community of language or feeling
with the Sclaves of Southern and
Western Hungary, from whom they
are separated by the intervention of
the Majjar country. The Ruthenes,
also in Northern Hungary, are distinct
from the Slovacks, occupy a
different portion of the slopes and
spurs of the Carpathians, and have no
connexion with the Sclaves on the
right bank of the Danube, from whom
they are separated by the whole
breadth of Hungary and Transylvania
at that point&mdash;they amount to about
400,000. The Croats, not quite
900,000 in number, are partly Roman
Catholics and partly belong to the
Greek Church. When religious toleration
was established in Hungary,
they exercised the power enjoyed by
the provincial assembly to exclude
Protestants from the country. The
Shocks of Sclavonia Proper, and the
Rasciens of that province and of the
Banat, amounting respectively to
above 800,000, and nearly half a
million, are tribes of the Serbe stock,
of whom the greater part adhere to the
Greek Church, and whose language
is different from that of the Croats,
the Slovacks, and the Ruthenes.
The Bulgarians, about 12,000, the
Montenegrins, about 2000, and the
Wends from Styria, about 50,000, are
small distinct tribes, speaking different
languages, and divided by religious
differences. But the whole of
these Sclavonic tribes have this in
common, that they are all animated
by a feeling of hatred to the German
race; and more than half of the
Sclave population of Hungary has
joined the Hungarians against Austria.</p>

<p>There was also a belief that the
Hungarians had oppressed the Sclaves,
and that the whole Sclave race would
therefore combine to put down their
oppressors. This was another misapprehension.
Great efforts have
been made by some of their poets and
their journalists to persuade the Sclaves
that they were oppressed; and the
Croat newspapers and pamphlets of
M. Gay, and the Austrian journals,
have circulated this belief over Germany,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">704</span>
whence it was disseminated
over Europe; but there seems to have
been no foundation for the charge.
The Sclaves enjoyed the same rights
and privileges as the Hungarians;
they were protected by the same laws;
they have shared equally with the
Hungarians in all the concessions
obtained by the Diet of Hungary, to
which the Sclaves sent their own representatives,
from the sovereign;
they bore less than their due proportion
of the public burdens, and they
were left in the enjoyment of their
own internal and municipal administration.
Croatia, where the movement
in favour of what was called
Illyrian nationality originated fifteen
or sixteen years ago, and where
it was fostered, curiously enough, by
the patronage of two imperial governments&mdash;Croatia
does not appear to
have any reason to complain of Hungarian
oppression. The Croats had
their own provincial assembly or diet,
which regulated the internal affairs of
the province, their own county assemblies,
their own Ban or governor,
they elected their own county and
municipal officers; a great part of the
province was organised as a part of
the military frontier, and was therefore
removed from the control of the
Hungarian Diet, and brought more
directly under the authorities at
Vienna. The only specific charge, so
far as we have been able to discover,
that they brought against the Hungarians
was, that the Majjars desired
to impose their language upon the
Croats. The history of the matter is
this,&mdash;Latin had been the language of
public business, of debates, and of the
decisions of courts of law in Hungary,
till the attempt of Joseph II. to substitute
the German excited a strong
national movement in favour of the
Majjar. From 1790 this movement
has been persevered in with the
greatest steadiness; and in 1830 an
act was passed by the Diet, and sanctioned
by the king, which decreed
that, after the 1st of January 1844,
no one could be named to any public
office who did not know the Majjar.
This completed the series of measures
which substituted that language for
the Latin, a language unintelligible to
the great body of the people. If a
living was to be substituted for a dead
language, no other than the Majjar
could well be selected. Besides being
greatly more numerous than any other
tribe speaking one language, the
Majjars were the wealthiest, the most
intelligent and influential; and their
language was spoken not only by their
own race, but by a large proportion
of the other inhabitants of the country&mdash;probably
by six or seven times as
many persons as used any other Hungarian
dialect. The Croats, whose language
was not that of any other tribe,
could not expect it to be chosen, and
all that was required of them to
employ the Majjar where they had
hitherto employed the Latin language,
and nowhere else.  The county of
Agram, the most important and populous
of the three counties of Croatia,
repudiated the notion of a separate
Illyrian nationality, of which, however,
the county town was the centre;
and clung to Hungary as the safeguard
of its liberty. The truth is that
the Croats, of whose hostility to the
Hungarians we have heard so much,
are nearly equally divided between
Hungary and Austria; and, but for
the military organisation which places
so large a portion of that people at
the disposal of Austria&mdash;and that the
most formidable portion&mdash;the agitators
for Illyrian nationality would probably
have been put down by their own
countrymen. The Slovacks, a people
of Bohemian origin, refugees from
religious persecution, have joined the
Hungarians. A great part of the
people of Sclavonia Proper have refused
to take part against Hungary.
The tribes that have engaged most
extensively and violently in hostilities
against the Hungarians have been
the people of Servian race, and of
the Greek church, in the counties of
the Lower Danube, and in Croatia.
Amongst the Hungarian Sclaves of
the Greek church, it is well known
that foreign influence has long been
at work, for which the Greek priesthood
are ready instruments. The
hopes of these tribes have been turned
towards the head of their church, and
the sympathies of thirty millions of
Eastern Sclaves who belong to the
same church.</p>

<p>Though feelings of nationality and
of race have been developed in Hungary,
as elsewhere, to an extent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">705</span>
hitherto unexampled, they have there
to contend with the craving for liberty,
which has at the same time acquired
intensity, and which amongst the
Sclaves has been fostered and inflamed
by the efforts of those who, for the
purpose of exciting them against the
Majjars, would persuade them that
they were the victims of oppression.
The more intelligent and influential
are now convinced, that it is to Hungary&mdash;to
which they owe the liberty
they enjoy&mdash;and not to anarchy, or to
Austria, against the attacks of whose
government Hungary has so long defended
their freedom and her own,
that they must look for advancement.</p>

<p>The relative positions of the peasants
and the nobles, and the antagonism
of these classes, enabled Austria
to exercise great influence and
even power in Hungary. The peasant
population, amounting to three millions
or more, now emancipated from
their disabilities and exclusive or disproportionate
burdens, and raised to
the rank and wealth of freeholders and
proprietors, by the liberality of the
nobles, have an equal interest with
them in defending the institutions to
which they owe their elevation.</p>

<p>The elements of discord, although
they were such as enabled agitators
to raise a part of the Sclaves against
the Hungarians, when it was resolved
to retract the concessions that had
been made to them, would hardly have
been found available for that purpose,
had not the instigators of the revolt
acted in the name of the King of
Hungary, and of more than one imperial
government; nor even then,
perhaps, had they not been enabled
to dispose of the resources of the
military frontier. Now that the Hungarians
have obtained important successes,
it is probable that the Sclaves
will all join them. The movement of
these tribes against the Hungarians,
which was caused by other influences
in addition to that of Austria, has
thus tended to lead the imperial government
into hostility with Hungary,
without contributing much to its
strength.</p>

<p>When the Austrian government
resolved to subjugate Hungary, it was
presumed that they undertook the
conquest of that country relying on
their own resources. But the success
of the enterprise was so doubtful, and
a failure so hazardous to the empire,
that we never could believe it possible
that it had been undertaken without
an assurance of support. It is true
that the imperial government might at
that time have expected an adjustment
of their differences with Sardinia; but
Venice still held out, peace with Sardinia
had not been concluded, the
state of Italy was daily becoming more
alarming, and the Austrian cabinet
knew that they could maintain their
hold of Lombardy, and reduce Venice,
only by means of a powerful army.
They were aware that the condition of
Galicia, and even of Bohemia, was
precarious, and that neither could
safely be denuded of troops. The state
of affairs in Germany was not such as
to give them confidence, still less to
promise them support; and the attitude
they assumed towards the assembly
at Frankfort, though not unworthy
of the ancient dignity of Austria, was
not calculated to diminish her anxiety.
Even in the Hereditary States all
was not secure. They were aware
that old sentiments and feelings had
been shaken and disturbed; that, although
order had for the time been
restored, by the fidelity and courage of
the army, men's minds were still unsettled;
and that, both in the capital
and in the provinces, there were factions
whose sympathies were not with
the imperial government, and which,
in case of disasters, might again become
formidable. The capital alone
required a garrison of twenty thousand
men, to keep it in subjection&mdash;to
preserve its tranquillity. Putting
aside, therefore, every consideration
as to the justice of the war, and looking
merely to its probable consequences,
it is obvious that, without
such a preponderance of power and
resources as would not only insure
success, but insure it at once&mdash;by one
effort&mdash;it would have been madness in
Austria, for the purpose of forcing her
constitution upon the Hungarians, to
engage in a contest in which she
staked her power&mdash;her existence&mdash;and
which could not fail to be dangerous
to her if it became protracted.</p>

<p>Let us then examine the resources
of both parties, and see what was the
preponderance on the side of Austria,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">706</span>
which would justify her in undertaking
so hazardous an enterprise, on the
supposition that she relied solely on
her own resources.</p>

<p>The Austrian empire contains a
population of 36,000,000; of these
about 7,000,000 are Germans&mdash;about
15,500,000 are Sclaves,&mdash;nearly
8,000,000 are of Italian and Dacian
races, and about 5,600,000 of Asiatic
races, including 5,000,000 of Majjars.
If from these 36,000,000 we
deduct the population of Hungary,
14,000,000, of Lombardy and Venice,
4,876,000&mdash;or, together, nearly
19,000,000, hostile to Austria&mdash;and
the population of Galicia, 4,980,000,
which did not contribute to her
strength, to say nothing of Bohemia
or Vienna, or Crakow, there will remain
to Austria, to carry on the war,
only 12,144,000. But, as probably
two millions of the Sclaves and other
tribes of Hungary, including the military
frontier, may have been reckoned
as on her side, that number may be
deducted from Hungary and added to
Austria. There will then remain to
Hungary a population of 12,000,000,
concentrated in their own country for
its defence, and to Austria about
14,000,000, whose military resources
must be distributed over her whole
dominions&mdash;from the frontiers of Russia
to those of Sardinia, from the frontiers
of Prussia to the confines of
Turkey&mdash;to re-establish her authority
in Lombardy, to reduce Venice to
submission, to hold the Sardinians
and the Italian republicans in check,
to control and overawe Galicia and
Crakow, to garrison Vienna and
maintain tranquillity at home, and,
finally, to conquer 12,000,000 of Hungarians.
It is true she had a noble
army, and Hungary then had almost
none, except such levies as she had
hastily raised, and which were as yet
without skilful commanders. But
Austria knew by experience the difficulties
and hazards of a war in Hungary.
Her government must have
known the resources of the country,
the courage and patriotism of its inhabitants,
and the success that had
attended their resistance to her forces
on more than one former occasion.
Surrounded by difficulties at home, in
Italy, and in Germany, with full one
half of the population of the empire
hostile to the government, she was
undertaking an enterprise which her
forces, in circumstances far more
favourable to success, had repeatedly
failed to accomplish.</p>

<p>Reviewing the whole of these considerations,
therefore, we hold it to
be quite incredible that the Austrian
government, having the alternative of
restoring peace, by permitting the
King of Hungary to fulfil his engagements
to his subjects, could have preferred
a war for the subjugation of
Hungary, if she had relied solely on
her own resources, or followed only
her own impulses and the dictates of
her own interest. We cannot doubt
that she was assured of foreign aid&mdash;that
her resolution to make war upon
Hungary, rather than keep faith with
her, was adopted in concert with the
power by which that aid was to be furnished.
If this inference be just, we
may find in that concert a reason for
the extraordinary accumulation of
Russian troops in Wallachia and Moldavia,
which appeared to threaten the
Ottoman Porte, but which also threatened
Hungary, where the only corps
that has been actively employed
found occupation. The feeling of
Germany made it unsafe to bring
Russian troops into Austria; but
the massing of Russian troops in the
Danubian principalities of Turkey
excited no jealousy in Germany.
Austria, too, shrinking instinctively
from the perils of Russian intervention,
while in reliance on that support
she pursued a bold and hazardous
policy, with a confidence which otherwise
would have been unintelligible
and misplaced, hoped perhaps to
escape the danger of having recourse
to the aid on which she relied.</p>

<p>Having employed all her disposable
means in the war, Austria now maintains
it at a disadvantage, for her own
defence. Her armies have been defeated,
her resources exhausted or
crippled, her capital is in danger, and
she must either concede the demands
of the Hungarians, or call in the armies
of Russia to protect her government
and enforce her policy. What the
demands of the Hungarians may now
be, we know not; but if they have
wisdom equal to the courage and
energy they have displayed, they will
be contented with the restitution of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">707</span>
their legal rights, which Austria may
grant without dishonour, because in
honour and good faith they ought
never to have been rejected. If
they are wise as they are brave, the
Hungarians will seek to restore unity
and peace to the empire with which
their lot has been cast&mdash;whose weakness
cannot be their strength&mdash;whose
independence is necessary to their own
security. That the intervention of
Russia would be fatal to the Austrian
empire, to its dignity, its power, its
capacity to fulfil the conditions of its
existence as a great independent state&mdash;the
guardian of eastern Europe&mdash;is,
we think, unquestionable. Attributing
no interested design to Russia&mdash;assuming
that she desires nothing so
much as the strength and stability of
the Austrian empire&mdash;we cannot doubt
that the re-establishment and maintenance
of the imperial government's
authority by the military force of
Russia, were it the best government
that ever existed, would desecrate, in
the heart of every German, the throne
of the Kaiser, and cover it with dust
and ashes. In a contest between the
Russians and the Hungarians, the
sympathy of all Germany, of all western
Europe, would be with the Majjars.
Half the Emperor of Austria's
own heart would be on the side of the
loyal nation to which his house owes
so large a debt of gratitude; who, he
must be aware, have been alienated
only by the errors and the injustice
of his advisers, and who, if they are
sacrificed, will not, and cannot be sacrificed
to his interests. Hungary was
perfectly satisfied with her constitution
and her government, as established
by the laws of April 1848.
She was loyal to her king, and careful
of the honour of Austria, which
she sent her best troops to defend in
another country; her crimes have
been her attachment to established
institutions, and the courage and patriotism
with which she has defended
them. This is not the spirit which it
can ever be the interest of a sovereign
to extinguish in <i>his own</i> subjects.
The desire to overturn established institutions
is the very evil which the
Emperors of Austria and Russia profess
to combat, and their first efforts
are to be directed against the only
Christian nation between the frontiers
of Belgium and Russia&mdash;between
Denmark and Malta, which was
satisfied with its institutions and
government, and determined to maintain
them.</p>

<p>If Russia engages seriously in the
war, she will put forth her whole
strength, and Hungary may probably
be overpowered; but can she forget
her wrongs or her successes?&mdash;will
she ever again give her affection to
the man who, claiming her crown as
his hereditary right, has crushed her
under the foot of a foreign enemy?
If anything can extinguish loyalty in
the heart of a Hungarian, the attempt
of the Emperor to put the Muscovite's
foot upon his neck will accomplish it.
We can imagine no degradation more
deeply revolting to the proud Majjar,
or more likely to make him sum up
all reasoning upon the subject with
the desperate resolution to sell his
life as dearly as he can. There is
therefore much reason to fear lest a
people, who but a few weeks ago
were certainly as firmly attached to
monarchy as any people in Europe,
not excepting either the Spaniards or
ourselves, should be driven by the
course Austria has pursued, and
especially by the intervention of Russia,
to renounce their loyalty and
consort with the enemies of monarchy.
Their struggle is now for life or death&mdash;it
ceases to be a domestic quarrel
from the moment Russia engages in
it; and Hungary must seek such
support as she can find. Austria has
done everything she could to convert
the quarrel into a war of opinion, by
representing it and treating it as
such; and now that she has brought
to her aid the great exemplar and
champion of absolute monarchy, it is
not impossible that she may succeed.</p>

<p>Russia comes forward to re-establish
by force of arms the authority of
a government which has been unable
to protect itself against its own subjects;
and, when re-established, she
will have to maintain it. How long
this military protection is to endure,
after all armed opposition is put
down, no man can pretend to foretell.
It must depend upon events which
are beyond the reach of human foresight.
But a government that is
dependent for its authority on a
foreign power, must, in every sense of
the term, cease to be an independent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">708</span>
government. Is it under Russian
protection that Austria is to preserve
Lombardy, or to maintain her influence
in Germany? Would the Sclavonic
population of Austria continue
to respect a German government protected
by a nation of Sclaves&mdash;would
they not rather feel that the real
power was that of their own race?
Would the Austrians forget the humiliation
of Russian protection, or
forgive the government that had
sacrificed their independence? Dependent
upon Russian protection, the
Austrian government could no longer
give security to Turkey, or counterbalance
the weight with which the
power of Russia, whatever may be
the moderation of the reigning emperor,
must continue to press upon
the frontiers of weaker countries. In
such a state of things, the relations
of Austria to the rest of Europe
would be changed&mdash;reversed. Instead
of being the bulwark of Germany
and the safeguard of Turkey
against Russia, she would become
the advanced post of Russia against
both. Is it to bring her to this condition
that she has allowed herself
to be involved in the war with
Hungary? Is it to arrive at this
result that she will consent to prolong
it?</p>

<p>Of the effect, in Germany, of the
Russian intervention in Austria, it is
almost superfluous to speak. The
advance of Russian armies, simultaneously
with the dissolution of more
than one refractory assembly, has
raised in the minds of men, already
in a state of furious excitement, a
suspicion that these events are not
unconnected, and that the Emperor
of Austria is not the only German
sovereign who is in league with the
Czar!  The time has arrived when the
question must be determined whether
order or anarchy is to prevail; and
we have no doubt that, in Germany
as in France, the friends of order will
speedily gain a complete ascendency&mdash;if
there be no foreign, and above
all, no Russian intervention. But to
very many of the patriotic friends of
order in Germany, Russian intervention
in her affairs, or an appearance
of concert between their own government
and Russia for the purpose of
influencing German interests, and
suppressing German feelings, would
be intolerable. There is reason to
apprehend that a great body of true-hearted
Germans, especially in the
middle classes&mdash;whose power must,
after all, decide the contest, and who
desire social order and security under
a constitutional monarchy&mdash;may
fancy they see in the advance of Russian
forces, at a moment when the
sovereigns, supported by their armies,
are making a stand against popular
tyranny, cause to fear that even their
constitutional freedom is in danger.
We are satisfied that there are no
reasonable grounds for such fears&mdash;that
the other governments of Germany
are too wise to follow the example
of Austria in her conduct
towards Hungary; but that example
cannot fail to produce distrust in
many minds already disposed to it;
and popular movements are more
influenced by passion than by reason.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to feel that
Russia is about to occupy a new position
in Europe, which, if no event
occurs to obstruct her in her course,
must greatly increase her influence
and her power for good or for evil.
She is to be the protector of Austria,
not against foreign enemies, but
against one of the nations of which
that empire is composed. She is to
re-establish and maintain, by military
force, a government which has been
unable to maintain itself against its
internal enemies&mdash;a government
which a nation of fourteen millions of
people has rejected, fought, and
beaten. A great power cannot interfere
in the internal affairs of another
state, to the extent of maintaining
there by force of arms a government
incapable of maintaining itself against
the nation, without getting involved
in the relations of the government it
upholds, to an amount of which it is
impossible to fix or to predict the
limits, but of which the tendency has
ever been, and must ever be, progressively
to increase the power of the
protecting over the protected government;
and the single fact that the
interests of Austria were in this manner
inseparably bound up, for a time
of indefinite duration, with those of
Russia, would give to the great
northern power a preponderance, both
in Europe and in Asia, such as no
hereditary monarchy has possessed in
modern times.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">709</span></p>

<p>With 150,000 or 180,000 men
in Hungary, Wallachia, and Moldavia,
the Russian armies would
encircle the frontiers of Turkey,
from the shores of the Adriatic to the
frontiers of Persia. With a government
in Austria dependent upon the
support of those armies, the power
that has hitherto been the chief security
of Turkey against the military
superiority of Russia, would be at the
command of the court of St Petersburg.
The Sclavonic tribes, which form the
chief part of the Turkish population
in Europe, seeing themselves enveloped
by the armies of Russia, guiding and
controlling the power of Austria, in
addition to her own, must be thoroughly
demoralised, even if Russia
should abstain from all attempts to
debauch them. They will feel that
they have no course left but to court
her, to look to her whose force is
visibly developed before them, is in
contact with them, surrounds them,
and appears to be irresistible everywhere.
They will find in the unity
of race an inducement to adhere to
the rising destinies of the great Sclavonic
empire&mdash;their instincts will
teach them to abandon, in time, the
fabric that is about to fall.</p>

<p>Forced to involve herself in all the
relations of the government she upholds,
Russia will come into immediate
contact with the minor German monarchies,
whose governments may
also stand in need of protection. There
is no one kingdom in Germany that
could then pretend to counterbalance
her power, or to resist her policy.
The same interests would carry her
influence, and it may be her arms,
into Italy. It will no longer be necessary
to negotiate the passage of
the Dardanelles by her fleet&mdash;the road
will be open to her troops, and the
passage of her fleet will no longer be
opposed.</p>

<p>We have not attributed to the Emperor
Nicholas, or to Russia, any ambitious
ulterior views in affording
assistance to Austria&mdash;we have supposed
him to be influenced only by
the most generous feelings towards a
brother emperor. But, to suppose
that he has no desire to extend his
own or his country's influence and
power&mdash;that he will not take advantage
of favourable circumstances to
extend them&mdash;would be absurd; and
were he to set out with the firmest
resolution to avoid such a result, the
course on which he is now said to
have entered, if he conducts it to a
successful issue, must, in spite of himself,
lead to that result. It is no answer,
therefore, to say that the Emperor
of Russia does not desire to
extend his territory; that he has abstained
with singular moderation from
interfering in the affairs of Europe,
while every capital was in tumult,
and every country divided against
itself. Giving him credit for every
quality that can adorn the loftiest
throne, the consequences of his present
policy, if it be successfully carried
out, are equally inevitable.</p>

<p>We must remember, on the other
hand, that after all, the Emperor of
Russia is but a man&mdash;but one man,
in an empire containing above sixty
millions of people. He is the greatest,
no doubt, the most powerful, perhaps
the ablest and wisest&mdash;the presiding
and the guiding mind, with
authority apparently absolute&mdash;but
they little know the details of an
autocratic government, who suppose
that he is uninfluenced by the will of
the nation, or has power to follow out
his own intentions. He must see
with other men's eyes, he must hear
with other men's ears, he must speak
with the tongues of other men. How
much of what is said and done in his
name, in his vast empire, and in every
foreign country, is it possible that he
can ever know? How much of his
general policy must, from time to time,
be directed by events prepared or consummated
in furtherance of their own
views, by his servants, and without his
knowledge! How often must he be
guided by the form in which facts
are placed before him, and by the
views of those who furnish them! It
is important, therefore, to inquire what
are the feelings and opinions, not of
the Emperor only, but of his servants
and guides&mdash;of the men who pioneer
for him, and prepare the roads on
which per force he must travel.</p>

<p>Shortly after the French revolution
of February 1848, a Russian diplomatic
memoir was handed about with
an air of mystery in certain circles in
Paris.  M. de Bourgoing, formerly
French minister at St Petersburg, and
author of a recent work, entitled,
<i>Les guerres d'idiome et de nationalité</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">710</span>
has published a commentary upon the
Russian memoir, which he tells us
was prepared by one of the ablest
and best-informed employés in the
Russian Chancellerie, after the events
of February. He further informs us
that it was presented to the Emperor
of Russia, and, with the tacit consent
of the Russian government, was sent
to be printed in a German capital, (the
impression being limited to twelve
copies,) under the title of "<i>Politique et
moyens d'action de la Russie impartialement
apprécié</i>."  The object of M. Bourgoing's
commentary, as well as of his
previous publication, appears to be to
remove exaggerated apprehensions of
the aggressive power and tendencies
of Russia, and the fears of a general
war in Europe, which her anticipated
intervention in Austria, and the occupation
in force of Wallachia and
Moldavia by her troops, had excited
in France. His fundamental position
appears to be, that the wars of 1848
and 1849 are essentially wars of language
and race; that France has
therefore nothing to fear from them;
and that Russia has neither a sufficient
disposable force, nor the slightest
desire to interfere, in a manner
injurious to France, in the affairs of
Western Europe. With this view
he combats, with a gentle opposition,
the reasoning of the Russian memoir,
which he represents as "une déclaration
où l'on est autorisé à voir une
espèce de manifeste envoyé sans
éclat par la Russie à ce qu'elle intitule
la révolution." From the tendencies
of M. Bourgoing's writings,
which occasionally peep out somewhat
thinly clothed, though they are
generally well wrapped up, we should
infer that the "ancien ministre de
France en Russie" does not consider
his connexion with the court of St
Petersburg as finally terminated; and
we do not doubt that he has good
warrant for all he says of the history
of this memoir.</p>

<p>But, whether or not we may be disposed
to assign to it a character of so
much authority as M. Bourgoing attributes
to that document, we cannot
but regard it as a curious illustration
of the kind of memoirs that Russian
diplomatists, "les plus habils et les
plus instuits," present to the Emperor,
and that the Russian government
"tacitly consents" to have transmitted
to a German capital to be
printed "sur-le-champ."</p>

<p>The Russian memoir commences
with the following general proposition,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Pour comprendre de quoi il s'agit
dans la crise extrême où l'Europe vient
d'entrer, voici ce qu'il faudrait se dire:
Depuis longtemps il n'y a plus en Europe
que deux puissances réelles, la Révolution
et la Russie. Ces deux puissances sont
maintenant en présence, et demain peut-être
elles seront aux prises. Entre l'une
et l'autre, il n'y a ni traité ni transaction
possibles. La vie de l'une est la mort de
l'autre. De l'issue de la lutte engagée
entre elles, la plus grande des luttes dont
le monde ait été témoin, dépend pour
des siècles tout l'avenir <i>politique et religieux</i>
de l'humanité.</p>

<p>La Russie est <i>avant tout l'empire
chrétien</i>; le peuple russe est chrétien,
non-seulement <i>par l'orthodoxie</i> de ses
croyances, mais par quelque chose de
plus intime encore que la croyance: il
l'est par cette faculté du renoncement et
du sacrifice, qui sont comme le fond de
sa nature morale.</p>

<p>Il y a heureusement sur le trône de
Russie un souverain en qui la pensée
russe s'est incarnée, et dans l'état actuel
du monde la pensée russe est la seule qui
soit placée assez en dehors du milieu
révolutionnaire pour pouvoir apprécier
sainement les faits qui s'y produisent.</p>

<p>Tout ce qui reste à la Bohême de
vraie vie nationale est dans <i>ces croyances
hussites</i>, dans cette protestation toujours
vivante de sa nationalité slave opprimée
contre <i>l'usurpation de l'église romaine</i>,
aussi bien que contre la domination de la
nation allemande. C'est là le lien qui
l'unit à tout son passé de lutte et de
gloire, et c'est là aussi le chemin qui
pourra rattacher un jour le Tchèque de la
Bohême à ses frères d'Orient.</p>

<p>On ne saurait assez insister sur ce
point, car ce sont précisément ces réminiscences
sympathiques de l'église d'Orient,
ce sont ces retours vers la <i>vieille foi</i> dont
le hussitisme dans son temps n'a été qu'une
expression imparfaite et défigurée, qui
établissent une différence profonde entre
la Pologne et la Bohême, entre la Bohême
ne subissant que malgré elle le <i>joug de la
communauté occidentale</i>, et cette Pologne
<i>factieusement catholique, seide fanatique
de l'Occident</i>, et toujours traître vis-à-vis
des siens."</p></blockquote>

<p>We add a few more extracts:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Que fera la Bohême, avec les peuples
qui l'entourent, Moraves, Slovaques, c'est-à-dire,
sept ou huit millions d'hommes de
même langue et de même race qu'elle?...
En general c'est une
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">711</span>
chose digne de remarque, que cette faveur
persévérante que la Russie, le nom Russe,
sa gloire, son avenir n'ont cessé de rencontrer
parmi les hommes nationaux de
Prague."&mdash;(Page 15.)</p></blockquote>

<p>At page 18 we find the following
observations upon Hungary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cette enemie c'est la Hongrie, j'entend
la Hongrie Magyar. De tous les ennemis
de la Russie c'est peut-être celui qui la
hait de la haine la plus furieuse. Le peuple
Magyar, en qui la ferveur révolutionnaire
vient de s'associer, par la plus étrange
des combinaisons, à la brutalité d'une
horde asiatique, et dont on pourrait dire
avec tout autant de justice que des Turcs,
qu'il ne fait que camper en Europe, vit
entouré de peuples Sclaves, qui lui sont
tons également odieux. Ennemi personel
de cette race, il se retrouve, après des
siècles d'agitation et de turbulence, toujours
encore emprisonné au milieu d'elle.
Tous ces peuple qui l'entourent, Serbes,
Croates, Slovaques, Transylvaniens, et
jusqu' au petits Russiens des Karpathes,
sont les anneaux d'une chaine qu'il
croyait à tort jamais briser. Et maintenant
il sent, audessus de lui, une main
qui pourra quand il lui plaira rejoindre ces
anneaux, et resserrer la chaine à volonté.
De là sa haine instinctive contre la Russie.</p>

<p>D'autre part, sur le foi de journalisme
étranger, les meneurs actuel du parti se
sont sérieusement persuadé que le peuples
Magyar avait une grande mission à remplir
dans l'Europe orthodoxe, que c'était
à lui en un mot à tenir en échec les destinés
de la Russie."</p></blockquote>

<p>If these are the mutual sentiments
of Russians and Majjars, we may form
some idea of the kind of warfare that
is about to be waged in Hungary.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe the confidence
with which the Russian diplomatist
assumes that the influence of
his master over all the Sclavonic tribes
of Hungary is completely established,
and points to the Emperor of Russia,
not to their sovereign, as the hand
that is to clench the chain by which
the Majjars are enclosed. When it is
remembered that this memoir was circulated
in Paris before any differences
had arisen between Austria and Hungary&mdash;that
the first movement hostile
to the Majjars was made by Sclavonic
tribes of the Greek Church, headed by
the Patriarch&mdash;that Austria long hesitated
before she resolved to break
faith and peace with Hungary&mdash;that
her own resources were inadequate to
the enterprise she undertook&mdash;that her
own interests appeared to forbid her
undertaking it&mdash;one is forced to ponder
and reflect on the means and influences
by which she may have been led into
so fatal an error.</p>

<p>We cannot refrain from giving one
other extract from the Russian memoir,
which is too pungent to be
omitted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Quelle ne serait pas l'horrible confusion
où tomberaient les pays d'Occident
aux prises avec la révolution, <i>si le légitime
souverain, si l'empereur orthodoxe d'Orient</i>,
tardait longtemps à y apparaître!</p>

<p>L'Occident s'en va; tout croule, tout
s'abîme dans une conflagration générale,
l'<span class="smcap">Europe de Charlemagne</span> aussi bien que
l'Europe des traités de 1815, la <span class="smcap">papaute
de Rome</span> <i>et toutes les royautés de l'Occident,
le catholicisme</i> et le protestantisme,
<i>la foi depuis longtemps perdue</i> et la raison
réduite à l'absurde, l'ordre désormais impossible,
la liberté desormais impossible,
et sur toutes ces ruines amoncelées par
elle, <i>la civilisation</i> se suicidant de ses
propres mains!</p>

<p>Et lorsque, audessus de cet immense
naufrage, nous voyons, <i>comme une arche
sainte</i>, surnager cet empire plus immense
encore, <i>qui donc pourrait</i> douter de sa
mission? Et est-ce à nous, ses enfans, à
nous montrer sceptiques et pusillanimes?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Such then, it appears, are the sentiments
of some of the most enlightened
of the Russian diplomatists&mdash;such
are the opinions and views presented
to the Emperor by the men on
whose reports and statements his
foreign policy must of necessity be
chiefly founded&mdash;such, above all, are
the feelings and aspirations, the enmities
and the means of action, which the
nation fosters and on which it relies.</p>

<p>It has been said that, in attacking
the Hungarians, Russia is but fighting
her own battle against the Poles, who
are said to compose a large proportion
of the Hungarian army; and those
who desire to throw discredit on the
Hungarian movement have nicknamed
it a Polo-Majjar revolution. They
must have been ignorant or regardless
of the facts. Whatever the Austrian
journals or proclamations may assert,
Russia must know full well that in
the Hungarian army there are not
more than five thousand Poles, and
only two Polish general officers, Dembinsk
and Bem.</p>

<p>That the Poles may think they see
in a war between Russia and Hungary
a favourable opportunity to revolt, is
not improbable, and that, if the Poles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">712</span>
should rise, they will find sympathy
and support in the nation that Russia
is attacking, must be inevitable.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Hungarians
are preparing for the unequal contest.
They have a well-equipped army of
160,000 men in the field, and a levy
of 200,000 more has been ordered.
Such is the national enthusiasm, that
this whole number may probably be
raised. This feeling is not confined to
the Majjars, but extends to the Sclavonic
population also.</p>

<p>The following extracts from a letter
received on the 14th May, by one of
his correspondents, from an intelligent
English merchant who has just
returned from a visit to the Sclavonic
districts of northern Hungary, on his
commercial affairs, gives the latest
authentic intelligence we have seen of
the state of things in the Slovack
counties, the only part of the country
which the writer visited:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am just returned from Hungary. I
was exceedingly surprised to see so much
enthusiasm. My candid opinion is that,
even if the Russians join against them,
the Hungarians will be victorious. They
are certainly short of arms; if they
could procure one or two hundred
thousand muskets, the affair would be
closed immediately. In the mountains
the cultivation of the land proceeds as
usual, although the whole neighbourhood
was full of contending troops. As I came
out of Hungary, the advanced guards
were only two German miles apart.
However, I found no inconvenience; the
roads were quite safe; and if it were not
for the guerillas, whom one expects every
minute to issue from the woods, the thing
would go on, for a stranger, comfortably
enough. The new paper-money (Kossuth's)
is taken everywhere, not only for the
common necessaries of life, but also for
large business transactions&mdash;the idea being
that there is about equal security for
Hungarian as for the Austrian bank-notes."</p></blockquote>

<p>It must be confessed, that in circumstances
calculated to try her prudence,
Russia has acted with singular
composure and wisdom. She abstained
from interfering in the affairs of western
Europe while the tide of republican
frenzy was in flood. She contented
herself with carefully and diligently
increasing and organising her army&mdash;then,
probably, in a more inefficient
state than at any time during the last
thirty years&mdash;and gradually concentrated
her disposable troops on her
western frontier, where magazines
have been prepared for it. While
continental Europe was convulsed
by revolutions, she made no aggression&mdash;the
occupation of Wallachia and
Moldavia was her only move in advance.
She avoided giving umbrage
to the people, to the sovereigns, or to
the successive governments that were
formed, and established a right to demand
confidence in her moderation
and forbearance. She came to the
aid of Austria at first with a small
force in a distant province, just sufficient
to show that the Austrian government
had her support, and not
enough to excite the jealousy of Germany.
Now that her military preparations
are completed, she comes to
protect Austria, not until she is called,
and at a time when the most formidable
dangers she has to encounter
are such as the friends of order,
triumphant in the west, and we trust
dominant everywhere, would be the
last to evoke. Yet it is impossible to
deny that the successful execution of
her present project would be a great
revolution&mdash;that it would more seriously
derange the relative positions of
nations, and the balance of power,
than any or all of those revolutions
which the two last eventful years have
witnessed.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the differences
between Austria and Hungary would
avert this danger&mdash;would remove all
hazard of throwing the power of Hungary
into the scale with the enemies
of monarchy&mdash;would re-establish the
Austrian empire upon the only basis on
which, as it appears to us, it is possible
to reconstruct it as an independent
empire; and would be "a heavy blow
and great discouragement" to the
anarchists, whose element is strife,
whose native atmosphere is the whirlwind
of evil passions. But if this
may not be&mdash;if Austria uses the power
of Russia to enforce injustice, and,
with that view, is prepared to sacrifice
her own independence&mdash;we should refuse
to identify the cause of monarchy
and order&mdash;the cause of constitutional
liberty, morality, and public faith&mdash;with
the dishonest conduct of Austria,
or the national antipathies and dangerous
aspirations of Russia.

<h2 id="FEUDALISM_IN_THE_NINETEENTH_CENTURY">FEUDALISM IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h2>

<p>It is not exactly the best of all
times to point out things that may be
amiss in, nor to find fault with either
portions or the whole of institutions
which have received the approving
sanction of time and experience; for
the bad passions of the lower and less
moral orders of men, in most European
nations, have of late been so
completely unchained, and the <i>débacle</i>
of the revolutionary torrent has been
so suddenly overwhelming, that no
extra impetus is required to be put
upon it. Rather should we build up
and repair the ancient dams and dikes
of society, anomalous and inconvenient
though they may be, than attempt
to remove them, even for the sake of
what may appear better ones, while
the waters of innovation are still out,
and when the spirit of man is brooding
over them for the elaboration of
some new chaos, some new incarnation
of evil. Nevertheless there are
a few noxious, and many harmless,
anomalies and contradictions in the
feudal or aristocratic constitution of
society, induced by the lapse of time,
the wear and tear of ages, which,
though they may not admit of removal
now, may demand it on the first convenient
opportunity; and then on
several of the sterner and more fundamental
principles of feudalism in
ancient days, upon which the basis of
modern society really exists, but
which have been lost sight of, and
yet which are forced into prominent
notice, and ought to be put in action
once more, by the morbid tendencies
of popular violence. We shall be
acquitted of all desire of change for
change's sake; no one will accuse us of
being habitual violators of ancient
things, customs, and laws: it is rather
because we love them, and venerate
them, and wish to revive them on
account of their intrinsic excellence,
that we would call our reader's attention
to a few things going on around
us. He need not be afraid of our
troubling him with a dry treatise on
the theory of government&mdash;we are no
constitution-mongers: he need not
expect to be bored with pages of statistical
details, nor to be satiated with
the nostrums of political economy.
We propose making one or two very
commonplace observations, professing
to take no other guide than a small
modicum of common sense, and to have
no other object than our readers'
delectation and the good of our country.</p>

<p>(1.) How was it that nobles came
to be nobles and commons came to be
commons? how was it that the great
territorial properties of this kingdom
were originally set agoing and maintained?
and how was it that you and
I, and millions of others, came to be
put in the apparently interminable
predicament of having to toil and
struggle with the world, or to be sentenced
to something like labour, more
or less hard, for life; you and I, we
say, you and I, and our fathers and
our children? Tell us that, gentle
reader, whether you be good old Tory,
or moderate Conservative, or slippery
Peelite, or coldblooded Whig, or profligate
Radical, or demoniac Chartist?
<span class="smcap">Force</span>, my good friend&mdash;<span class="smcap">FORCE, PHYSICAL
FORCE</span>&mdash;a good strong hand, and
stout arm, and a heavy sword, and
brave heart, and a firm determination&mdash;and
no shilly-shally hesitation
as to legality or illegality, no maudlin
sympathy nor compunction&mdash;these
were the things that did it; these
carried the day; these were the moving
powers of old; they raised the
lever, and they settled down society
into that bed in which it has been
arranging itself ever since. And right
good things they were, too, in their
proper time and place; and so they
ever will be: they are some of the
mainsprings of the world; they may
become concealed in their action, they
may be forgotten, they may even fall
into temporary inaction, but they
come out again into full play ever and
anon, and, when the wild storm of
human passion drives over the world
in a reckless tornado, they go along
with the whirlwind, and they hover
all around it, and they follow it, and
they reassert their permanent sway
over mankind. The Norman William's
barons, the noble peers of Charlemagne,
the princes and marshals of
Napoleon, all found their estates at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">714</span>
points of their swords; and, while they
kept their swords bright, their estates
remained intact; but, when military
prowess declined, legal astuteness and
commercial craft crept in, and the
broad lands decreased, because the
sharp point and edge were blunted.
The remote origin, the first title of
every crowned head and noble family
of Europe, is to be traced to the
sword, or has been derived from it.
We speak not of <i>parvenus</i>, we allude
to the great families of the various
realms of the ancient world; all <i>old</i>
and <i>real</i> nobility is of the sword, and
of the sword only. The French used
to express this well, and understood
the true footing on which nobility
ought to stand; they always talked
of la noblesse de l'epée, as contradistinguished
from <i>la noblesse de la robe</i>:
the former referred to the feudal families
and their descendants, the latter
to those who had become ennobled
for services at the bar. As for nobility
granted for any commercial or
pecuniary causes, they never dreamed
of such a thing; or, if a spurious
ennobling took place, it was deemed a
glaring and an odious violation of the
fundamental laws of aristocratic society.</p>

<p>Now the ideas of the world have
become so changed, or rather so corrupted,
on this point, that the prime
notion of nobility no longer is attached
to military tenure or service; but, on
the contrary, we find titles given, nay,
bought and sold, for any the most
miscellaneous services, and the meridian
of nobleness, of elevation, of
power, altogether eliminated from the
qualifications that the nobleman ought
to possess. Back-stair services, lobby
services, electioneering services, counting-house
services, any services as
well as military services, have been
deemed sufficient causes for procuring
a patent of nobility to those who could
allege them. Titles and causes of
distinction they might have been, but
surely not of nobility, not of hereditary
honour and distinction, the tenure
and essence of which should ever be
attached to territorial power gained
and held by the sword. And this
lowering of the tone of nobility, this
communising of what ought to be ever
held up as a thing apart, as a thing
originating with the first beginnings
of a nation, and remaining fixed till
the nation becomes itself extinct,
has done no good to society: it has
not raised the tone of the commons,
it has only lowered that of the
nobles: it has emasculated the one
without adding any strength to the
other. In all nations, as long as the
nobility have remained essentially a
military order, holding their own by
their own strength, the fortunes of
that nation have advanced; but whenever
the nobles have become degenerate,
and therefore the commons
licentious&mdash;the former holding only
by prescriptive respect, and the latter
subjected to them only in theory, not
in practice&mdash;the fate of that nation
has been pronounced, and its decline
has already begun. The destruction
and absorption of the good fiefs of
France, in the time of Louis XI., laid
the way for the razing of the châteaux,
and the decapitation of their owners
by the Cardinal de Richelieu, in the
time of Louis XIII.; and this gradual
degenerating process of undermining
the true strength of the nobles, led to
the corruption of the nation, and to
its reduction to the primary starting-point
of society in the reign of Louis
XVI.  So, too, in England, the
sapping of the strength of the nobles,
in the reign of Henry VIII., added
to the corrupt proceedings of the
times of James I., caused the Great
Rebellion in the reign of his successor.
The nation has never recovered from
this fatal revolution of the seventeenth
century. Like France, England has
shone awhile, and sustained itself
both in arts and arms; but the dissolving
process has begun long ago
with us as it did with them. One order
of the state&mdash;the order of nobles&mdash;has
been constantly decreasing in power
and influence; and the descent towards
the level of anti-social democracy
seems now as easy and as broad
as that to the shades of Avernus. The
nobles of Russia, on the contrary, still
retain their feudal power&mdash;they all
draw and use the sword: their nation
is on the ascendant. In Spain and
Italy the nobles have descended so far
as almost to have lost their claim to
the title of <i>men</i>; while in most parts
of Germany the result of recent movements
has shown that the power of
the nobles had long been a mere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">715</span>
shadow; and they have evaporated
in empty smoke, while the nations
are fast sinking to the level of a common
and savage democracy.</p>

<p>We would propose a remedy for
this state of things. We consider the
profession of arms, when joined to the
holding of territorial power, as the
highest form of civilisation and political
excellence to which man has yet
been able to rise.  It constitutes that
union of all the highest and best feelings
of human nature with the supreme
possession of power and influence
over material objects&mdash;over
land and the produce of land&mdash;which
seems to be the ultimate and the
worthy object of the good and great
in all ages. And, therefore, the nearer
a nobleman can revert to the principles
upon which his order is, or
ought to be, based, the greater security,
in the working out both for
himself and the nation, that the
strength and dignity of the whole
people shall be maintained inviolate.
Of all men in the state, the noble is
he who is most endangered by any
approximation to effeminacy and inactivity:
he is the representative, the
<i>beau ideal</i>, of the virility of the whole
nation: he is the active principle of
its force&mdash;the leader, the chief agent,
in building up the fortunes of his country.
Let him but once degenerate from
the elevating task, and he renounces
the main privileges of his order, he
does wrong both to his fellow-countrymen
and to himself&mdash;he diminishes
his own force, and he weakens their
national powers. Whenever, therefore,
any such departure, more or less
wide, from the ancient principles of
his order has taken place, let the
nobleman hasten to return to them, if
he would stop the course of ruin before
it become too late. We would
hold it to be the duty of every nobleman
in this country&mdash;and we include
herein his immediate descendants&mdash;to
enter the profession of arms, and
to adopt no other save that of afterwards
serving the state in the senate:
we hold it to be his duty to avoid all
approximation to the engagements of
commerce&mdash;we would even say of the
law, of any of the learned professions.
These pursuits are intended for other
orders of men, not less essential to
the state than the noble, but still different
orders. The noble is the leader,
the type, the example of public military
and political strength. Let him
keep to that lofty function, and discharge
it and no other.</p>

<p>Two methods of effecting this present
themselves. In the first place, a
regulation might be easily and advantageously
made, in connexion with
the army, whereby any nobleman, or
son of a nobleman, or in fact any
person belonging to the class which
the law might define to be noble, (for
some modification is wanted on this
head,) might be allowed to attach
himself as a volunteer officer to any
regiment, and be bound to serve in it
as such, without pay. He should
receive his honorary promotion the
same as any other officer, and should
be subject to all the same duties and
responsibilities; but "pay" he should
not need; himself or his family should
provide for all his charges. Or, in
the second place, he should serve as
an officer in a national force, the constitution
of which we propose and
advocate below: in this case, too,
entirely without pay, and subject to
all the articles of war. In either
instance, we think it the duty of the
country to give the nobleman an
especial opportunity of serving her in
a military manner; and we hold it to
be his especial duty&mdash;one of the most
essential duties of his order, without
which his order degenerates and stultifies
itself&mdash;to serve as a military
man, and to serve with distinction.</p>

<p>We often hear it said that the
English are not a military people;
that they do not like an army; that
they have a natural repugnance to
the military profession, and other
similar pieces of nonsense or untruth.
Such libels as these on the innate
courage of an Englishman, are never
uttered but by those who have something
of the calf in their hearts; the
wish is father to the thought in all
such declarations, when seriously
made; and, if alleged as matters of
argument, they are used only by the
morbid lovers of <i>la paix à tout prix</i>
who infest our age and country. It
is just the same as when you hear a
man say soberly, that he does not like
shooting, nor hunting, nor fishing;
that he cannot ride, nor drive, nor
swim; that he cannot abide the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">716</span>
country, and that he prefers a constant
residence in town. Such a man
is not only a useless, he is positively
a noxious member of society&mdash;he is
an excrescence, a deformity, a nuisance,
and the sooner his company is
avoided the better. Such men, however,
do exist, and they do actually
say such things; but they are tokens
of the debased and degrading effects
of over-civilisation, of social degeneracy,
of national humiliation; and
whenever their sentiments shall come
to be approved of, or assented to, by
any large portion of the people, then
we may be sure that the decline and
fall of the nation are at hand, and
that our downward course is fairly
commenced. No; the men and the
nation that can, in cool blood, repudiate
the noble profession of arms,
forfeit the virility of their character,
they may do very well for the offices
that slaves, and the puny denizens of
crowded cities, can alone perform;
but they deserve to lose the last relics
of their freedom, for thus daring to
contradict one of the great moral laws
of nature. Force and courage have
been awarded to man like any other
of his faculties and passions; they
were intended to be exercised, otherwise
they would not have been given:
their exercise is both good and necessary;
and, like their great development,
War, they are destined by our Maker
to be the causes and instruments of
moral and physical purification and
renovation. As long as the mind and
body of man continue what they are,
the Profession of Arms and the Science
of War will be held in deserved
honour among the great and good of
mankind.</p>

<p>Great evils have no doubt resulted
from their use, and more especially
from their abuse; but not a whit
greater than from the use and abuse
of any other of the faculties and propensities
of man: not so much as
from the spirit of deceit and oppression,
which is the concomitant of
trading and manufacturing operations;
not so much as from the spirit of
religious fanaticism and superstition
which haunts the human race; not
so much as from the gluttony and
sensuality of civilised nations. War
and Arms are analogous to the Tempest
and the Thunderbolt, but they
purify more than they destroy, and
they elevate more than they depress.
The man that does not arm in defence
of his country, of his family, and of
himself, deserves to die the death of
a dog, or to clank about for endless
years in the fetters of a slave.</p>

<p>It has been well shown, by one of
the most philosophic of modern historians,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
that the final causes of war
are indissolubly united with the moral
constitution of man and human society;
and that, as long as man continues to
be actuated by the same passions as
hitherto, the same causes of war must
occur over and over again in endless
cycles. Not but that the pain and
misery thereby caused are undoubted
evils, but that evil is permitted to
form part of the moral and physical
system of the world; it is what constitutes
that system a state of probation
and moral trial for man. When evil
ceases to exist, men's evil passions shall
cease also, and the world shall become
another Eden; <i>but not till then</i>. The
bearing of arms and the waging of
war are no disgrace to a nation;
they are an honour and a blessing to
it if justly exercised, a disgrace and a
curse, sooner or later, if undertaken
unjustly. Believing, therefore, that
the proper maintenance of a warlike
spirit is absolutely essential to the
welfare of any nation, and knowing
how much the pecuniary and political
embarrassments of our mighty though
heterogeneous empire cripple the public
means (in appearance at least) for
keeping up a sufficient military force,
we proceed to throw out the following
hints for the formation of an improved
description of a national military
force. And we may at once
observe, that it is one especially calculated
to fall under the direction of
the nobles of the land, and to revive
that portion of the feudal spirit which
depends on the proper constitution of
the military resources of a great people.</p>

<p>The military strength of this
country lies at present concentrated
in the regular army, in the corps
of veterans styled "pensioners,"
and, we may very fairly add, in
the "police." We have nothing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">717</span>
say except in praise of these three
bodies of men, the two latter of which
are most useful adjuncts and supporters
to the former. But we not
only wish that the number of the regular
army were <i>permanently and
considerably increased</i>, we could desire
also that the number of the police
were augmented, and that they had
more of military training about them.
We shall revert to one of these points,
at least, at a future period. We are
also of opinion that the militia of the
country should <i>always</i> be kept up,
and regularly trained even in the intervals
of war, were it for no other
purpose than to maintain some faint
degree of military spirit and knowledge
among the common people.
The question of expense and of interruption
to labour does not, we confess,
stop us in the least in our aspirations:
we think that the country pays not a
farthing too much for its military and
naval forces; and, as for interruption
to labour, anything that would draw
off the attention of the lower orders
from the grinding and degrading occupations
of manufacturing slavery, we
should consider one of the greatest benefits
that could accrue to the country.</p>

<p>We wish to call attention, however,
to another method&mdash;by no means a
new one&mdash;of augmenting the military
resources of the country, and to throw
out some hints for rendering that method
more efficacious than it may
hitherto have been deemed. We
allude to the system of volunteers.
And here let not our military readers
laugh: we would assure our gallant
friends that we are fully aware of the
thousand and one objections that will
be immediately started; we know
how easy it is to pooh-pooh a plan of
this kind all to nothing. We can already
hear them calling out about the
Lumber Troop, and the City Light
Horse: nay, we ourselves can actually
remember that most astounding and
heart-stirring event of the late war,
the storming of Putney, and the battle
of Wimbledon Common. We were
present, gallant readers, not as actors
but as very juvenile spectators of that
memorable combat, to which Austerlitz,
Borodino, and Waterloo were
mere farces; so we know all that is
to be said <i>against</i> the volunteers. And
now just have the goodness to let us
say something <i>for</i> them.</p>

<p>A volunteer force, if it is to be
merely a parade force, a make-believe
force, is a "sham," a humbug, and a
gross absurdity. If it is to be a
"National Guard," playing the part
of armed politicians, it is a dangerous
nuisance, and ought never to be
formed. If it is to consist of a crowd
of pot-bellied citizens, with red noses
and spectacles, who are afraid of firing
off a musket, and cannot march above
ten miles a day, nor go more than six
hours without plenty of provisions
tucked under their belts, nor sleep
anywhere except between clean sheets
and warm blankets&mdash;why, a set of
wooden posts, sculptured into the
human form, and painted to look like
soldiers, would be far more serviceable.
We are not going to commit
the absurdity of advocating the formation
of any such corps of men as
these; but we wish to point out how
a really efficient corps of volunteers
might be raised throughout the kingdom,
kept on a footing of constant
service and readiness, costing the
country not one farthing, and constituting
a really useful and valuable
auxiliary force to co-operate with the
regular troops.</p>

<p>If these qualifications are to exist
in any volunteer corps, then it is quite
manifest that the following kinds of
persons cannot form part of it. First
of all, the whole generation of pot-bellied,
red-nosed, counter-thumping
fellows, alluded to above, would not be
admissible; next, no man who is not
endowed with a good quantity of bodily
activity, health, and vigour of
mind, could remain in its ranks; and
further, no one need apply for admission
who wanted merely to "play at
soldiers," or whose means and occupations
would not allow of his giving
up regularly a certain portion of his
best time to the service, and <i>occasionally</i>
of absenting himself from
home for even a considerable period&mdash;say
of one, two, or more months, and
proceeding wherever the government
might wish him. Furthermore, no
such corps could have the smallest
pretensions to be effective, if it were
left to its own guidance and command:
it must be as much under the
control, and at the orders, of the commander-in-chief&mdash;for
home service&mdash;(for
we do not contemplate the possibility
of its being ordered abroad,) as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">718</span>
any of the regular corps in her
Majesty's army.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once, from the
above stipulations, that we do not
advert to anything at all resembling
the loose and extremely local organisation
of the old volunteers of 1805
and the subsequent years.</p>

<p>Now, a volunteer corps can only be
held together by the two following
principles:&mdash;first, a strong sense of
public and patriotic duty; and, secondly,
an acute feeling of Honour,
and the Pride of belonging to a really
distinguished arm of the service&mdash;a
bona fide <i>corps d'élite</i>. Whenever war
breaks out, we know, and we feel the
most hearty satisfaction in knowing,
that in every corner of the land&mdash;save,
perhaps, in the murky dens of misery,
discontent, and degeneracy abounding
in our manufacturing towns&mdash;thousands
of British hearts will beat with
a tenfold warmer glow than heretofore,
and will burn to give forth their
best blood for the services of their
country. Let but the most distant
intimation of foreign invasion be given,
and hundreds of thousands of brave
and generous defenders of their beloved
native land will instantly step
forth. But we would say that, if the
defence of the country from invasion
be really desirable, it is not sufficient
that the <i>will</i> to defend it be forthcoming
at the proper moment&mdash;the <i>knowledge
how to do it</i>, the <i>preparatory
training</i>, the <i>formation of military
habits</i>,&mdash;always a matter of slow
growth,&mdash;the <i>previous organisation of
the defenders themselves</i>, is much more
important. In short, to keep the
country safe from foreign invasion,
(we do not allude to the naval strength
of the country, which, after all, may
prove abundantly sufficient for the
purpose,) to take away from a foreign
enemy even the spirit to dare an invasion,
the previous formation, the
constant maintenance of an efficient
volunteer force must necessarily be of
great value.</p>

<p>The expediency of this will be heightened
by the consideration that it may,
at any time, even of the most profound
peace in Europe, be found necessary
suddenly to detach a large portion of
the regular army for the defence of
our numerous colonial possessions,
or that disturbances among our manufacturing
population at home may
require a sudden augmentation of the
armed force of the country. In either
of these emergencies, the existence
of a considerable body of armed men
who, though perhaps not equalling
the regulars in <i>precision</i> of discipline
and evolution, might yet be in far
better training than the militia, <i>and
who should be kept so at no expense to
the government</i>, would evidently be of
great value to the whole community.</p>

<p>We do not expect that many persons
engaged in trade and manufactures,
nor indeed that many inhabitants
in large towns&mdash;at least of those
classes&mdash;would like to enrol themselves
in a corps the service of which would
be constant, and might frequently take
them away for a considerable time
from their homes and occupations. We
should not wish to see them joining
it, for, however warm their goodwill
might be, we know that their pockets
and stomachs would be continually
rebelling, and that, far from being
"volunteers," they would more commonly
be found as "deserters."  We
would rather see them staying at
home, and acting as good members of
their municipalities, or as special constables,
or forming "street associations"
for the keeping of the peace&mdash;all
most necessary and laudable purposes,
and not a whit less useful to the
country than the serving as volunteers.
We would rather see the force we
meditate drawn exclusively from the
gentry and the farmers of the country,
and in fact from the same classes as
now furnish the yeomanry cavalry,&mdash;only,
we would have it most especially
to include <i>all the gentry of the nation</i>:
and we would have it thereby made
an <i>honour</i> even to belong to the corps.
To see a country gentleman heading
his tenants, and his sons serving in
their ranks, as some of themselves,
and the younger gentry from the
country or provincial towns also coming
forward for the permanent military
service of their country&mdash;coming forward
as gentlemen, and serving as
gentlemen, with the name and title
of gentlemen&mdash;and to see the stout
farmers of England, the real pride and
bulwark of the realm, thus linked
with their best and natural friends
and protectors in a common bond of
honour and of arms, would be the most
glorious sight that this nation would
have witnessed for many a long year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">719</span>
It would give a new stamp to society,
and would infuse a vigorous energy of
mind amongst us that should go far
towards counteracting the dangerous
and emasculating influence of the
"large town system." The heart-blood
of England would begin to flow
back again into its old and natural
channels; and that linking of lords and
tenants, which can never be loosened
without the most fatal consequences,
would be rendered closer and tighter
than ever.</p>

<p>Men drawn from such classes as
these, the adult sons of respectable
farmers, the sons of the country gentry,
the younger gentry from the towns,
the farmers and the gentry themselves,
(such at least as could really be spared
from their numerous avocations,)
would constitute, both in their physical
and mental qualifications, the very
best description of volunteers that
could be selected in any land, for they
would be the true <i>élite</i> of the whole
nation, the very pride and hope of the
country. It would be truly an honour
to belong to such a corps, whether
the applicant for admission were a
yeoman or a gentleman; and, if properly
organised and trained, it might
be made a force of paramount efficiency.</p>

<p>Now what would be some of the
main characteristics of the men composing
such a force? for by those
characteristics the nature and destination
of the force should be mainly
guided. First of all, a large portion
would be able, as now, to serve on
horseback: and this leads at once to
show that the yeomanry cavalry, if
more frequently exercised, and if kept
out for longer periods of service,
might, with an improvement which
we shall by-and-by suggest, become
of great value in this division of the
national force.</p>

<p>Next, men of this kind would be
more or less distinguished for bodily
activity&mdash;we mean activity, as distinguished
from muscular strength&mdash;though
of this they would have in the
old proportion of one Englishman to
any two Frenchmen, we have no
doubt. Hence the force would be
fitter for the service of light than of
heavy armed troops.</p>

<p>And, thirdly, from their pecuniary
means they would be capable of <i>distant</i>
and <i>rapid</i> motion; and therefore they
should form a corps destined for quick
and desultory rather than for slow
and stationary warfare.</p>

<p>From the very fact, however, of
their forming a corps drawn from the
middle classes of provincial and urban
society, and from their having pecuniary
means at their command, more
than any other class of troops could
possibly hope for, they would be
especially liable to relax in discipline
from the contamination of garrisons,
or the seductions of large towns. They
would be formed of the finest young
fellows of the whole country; and
therefore a residence at "Capua"
would be destructive of their military
efficiency. The damage they would
reciprocally cause and sustain by
being quartered in any large town for
a lengthened period, might be great;
hence they should be confined as much
as possible to&mdash;where they would be
most effective&mdash;operations in the open
field.</p>

<p>Again, if there are any two points
of manly exercise in which the gentry
and yeomanry of this country are
distinguished beyond any other European
nation, they are these&mdash;the being
<i>good marksmen</i>, and <i>good horsemen</i>.</p>

<p>We are thus naturally led to the
determining of the exact description
of troops which should be constituted
with such admirable materials&mdash;<i>a vast
body of riflemen</i>&mdash;some mounted, the
others on foot. Such a corps, or
rather such an assemblage of corps, if
properly organised and trained, would
not have its equal in the world. It
would be formed of the choicest spirits,
the picked men of the nation, and it
would be organised upon the very
points, as bases, upon which those
men would the most pride themselves,
in which they would be the strongest,
which they would be the most accustomed
to, and would the best understand.
They would have all the elements
of good soldiers among them;
all that would be wanting would be
good organisation and training.</p>

<p>"This is no great discovery," some
one will say; "there have been volunteer
rifle corps already. Of late days
they started a thing of the kind among
the peaceable Glasgow bodies, and
those treasonable asses, the Irish.
Irishmen that wanted to be rebels,
and the English Chartists that wanted
to sack London, recommended their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">720</span>
deluded countrymen to 'club together
and buy rifles.'" We acknowledge it&mdash;the
idea is old enough. We only
mean to say, that if a volunteer force
be a desirable adjunct to our military
system&mdash;and, under certain regulations,
it might no doubt become so&mdash;then
a rifle corps, or rather an army
of volunteer riflemen, drawn from the
classes specified above, would constitute
a most effective branch of the
service. We make no pretensions to
the starting of a new idea; we merely
endeavour to render that idea practicable,
and to point out how it may be
best realised.</p>

<p>The following points as to organisation
we lay down as indispensable,
without which we should hardly care
to see the force enrolled:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st, The only matter in which the
volunteer spirit should subsist, should
be that of joining the corps in the first
instance, and then of equipping and
maintaining the men, each at their
own cost. Once enrolled, it should
no longer be at the option of the men
whether they served or not&mdash;nor <i>when</i>,
nor <i>where</i>, nor <i>how</i> they served: we
mean the force not to be a sham one;
we do not want soldiers in joke, we
require them to come forward in good
earnest. All matters concerning the
time, place, and mode of their service
should lie with the government.
Once enrolled and trained, they should
be at her Majesty's disposal; they
should be her <i>bonâ fide</i> soldiers, only
not drawing pay, nor, except under
certain circumstances, rations.</p>

<p>2d, The corps should be raised by
counties, hundreds, and parishes, and
should be under the colonelcies of the
Lords-Lieutenants or their deputies.
To keep up the <i>esprit de corps</i> conjointly
with the spirit of local association
and public patriotism, it is essential
that friends and neighbours, lords
and tenants, should stand side by side,
fight in the same ranks, witness each
other's brave deeds, and, in every sense
of the word, "put shoulder to shoulder."
The several counties might each
furnish a regiment, and these regiments
should then be brigaded under
the command of a general officer, appointed
by the commander-in-chief of
her Majesty's forces. In the first
instance, at least, it would be desirable
that a certain proportion of the officers
should be drawn from the half-pay list
of the army, both for the sake of instruction
and example. Afterwards
they should be taken <i>from the ranks</i>,
for the ranks in this corps would be,
by the mere fact of their organisation,
composed of gentlemen and the best
description of yeomen&mdash;the latter, be
it ever remembered, not unworthy to
lead their friends and neighbours;
and the mode of so doing might be
easily arranged by the military authorities,
on the combined footing of
local influence and personal merit.</p>

<p>3d, These corps, when organised,
should be primarily intended for the
local defence of their several counties,
or of any adjacent military districts,
into which the country might, from
time to time, be divided. But they
should also be liable to serve, to the
same extent as the militia, anywhere
within the European dominions of Her
Majesty. We do not contemplate the
eventuality of their being ordered on
foreign service, though we strongly
suspect that it would be very difficult
to keep such a corps always at home,
when stirring scenes of national arms
and glory were to be met with away
from their own shores. If, however,
the corps should be called on to do duty
away from their own military districts,
then they should draw rations, clothes,
equipments, and ammunition, but <i>not
pay</i>, the same as the regular troops.</p>

<p>4th, As it should be esteemed an
honour to belong to such a corps, so
the members of it should not only be
exempt from being drawn for the
militia, but they should also be free
from paying for a license to carry firearms
and to shoot as sportsmen; and
the cost of their equipment should be
such as to insure a certain degree of
respectability on the part of the volunteer.
This preliminary expense,
added to that of maintaining himself
on duty at his own cost, would prevent
any one but a man of a certain
degree of substance from seeking admission
into the corps.</p>

<p>5thly, The acquisition of sufficient
skill in the use of that deadliest of all
arms, the rifle, might be made by
means of local meetings to practise,
at which heavy fines for non-attendance
would not only insure tolerable
regularity, but would also provide a
fund for prizes, and for general purposes.
At these meetings, which
should be held frequently, the knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">721</span>
of military evolutions, and the
minutiæ of drill might be readily
communicated by the non-commissioned
officers of the pensioners' corps;
and, from the circumstance of the
men not being mere clods from the
plough tail, nor weavers from the
loom, the requisite amount of instruction
would be conveyed in a comparatively
short time. We should
suppose that, within six months from
their first organisation, if the discipline
was well attended to, such corps
might be able to stand a field-day
before their general officers. The
cavalry would not learn their duties
so readily as the infantry, because
the men would have to teach not
themselves alone, but also their horses;
and, though they would form a most
effective and valuable species of light
cavalry, the combined practice of the
rifle and the sabre would demand a
considerable time for the corps to be
quite at home with their duties. We
would give them a year to make
themselves complete. A volunteer
force of cavalry should never aim at
being anything else than a corps of
light horse&mdash;they can never constitute
effective heavy cavalry. But as
light horsemen possessing rifles, and
able to use them whether in the
saddle or on the ground, they would
become as formidable to a European
enemy as the African Arabs have
been to the French, and would be a
match for any light cavalry that could
be brought to act against them. For
all purposes, too, of local service they
would be admirably efficient.</p>

<p>6thly, The discipline of a volunteer
corps is always the main difficulty to
be contended against in its practical
management; but we conceive that
this difficulty would be lessened, in
the present instance, from the peculiarly
good composition of the rank
and file of such a body of men.
Several large classes of military offences
could not possibly prevail
among them; and, for those that
remained, the ordinary articles of
war would be sufficiently repressive.
It should be observed that we do not
contemplate the granting leave to
such corps to disband themselves:
the engagement once formed should
be binding for a certain moderate
number of years, and the volunteer
should not have the faculty of releasing
himself from his duties except
by becoming invalided. We imagine
that the possibility of being ultimately
dismissed from such an honourable
body of men, for ungentlemanlike
conduct, would constitute the most
effectual check that could be devised
for the instances of breach of discipline
likely to occur.</p>

<p>It should not be lost sight of that
we advocate the formation of such a
force as a <i>corps d'élite</i>, as one elevated
above the militia, and even above the
regular army, in the <i>morale</i> of the
men composing it, if not in their
<i>physique</i>; and therefore it may be
very fairly inferred that the members
of it, feeling the <i>prestige</i> attached to
their name, would act up to the dignity
and honour of their station; that
they would not only behave as valiant
soldiers in the field, but that they
would act as gentlemen in quarters.
Drinking and gambling would be the
two main offences to provide against;
but these, if discouraged, and not practised
by the officers, might be checked
among the men. For all quarrels and
disputes likely to end in personal
encounter, a special tribunal of arbiters
should be constituted among
men and officers of corresponding rank
in the corps; and all duelling should
be totally prevented. The mere fact
of sending or accepting a challenge
should involve, <i>ipso facto</i>, expulsion
from the corps. The running into
debt, too, on the part of the members,
should be most rigorously prevented,
and should incur the penalty of expulsion.
By these and similar regulations,
combined with the judicious
management of the superior officers,
we have no doubt that the discipline
of such a body, (which should be
strict rather than lenient,) might be
effectually maintained.</p>

<p>7thly, The arming and equipping
of such a corps of men is a point of
importance, but by no means of difficulty.
We may here disappoint some
of our pseudo-military readers; but
we anticipate that the real soldiers
will agree with us, when we declare
our conviction that a military costume&mdash;we
do not say a <i>uniform</i>
costume&mdash;but a <i>military</i> one, would
be altogether out of character and
needless in such a case. No: we
would not have any of the smart
shakos, and tight little green jackets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">722</span>
of the rifle brigade; no plumes nor
feathers; no trailing sabres for the
officers, no cartouche boxes for the
men&mdash;nothing at all of the kind. We
would put them all in uniform, but
not in a uniform of that nature&mdash;it
should be one suited to the wearers,
and to the nature of their service.</p>

<p>Now the original intent and object
of all uniform costume is, not the
ornamenting of the person; it is not
the dressing of a young fellow, until
he becomes so handsome that the
first woman he meets is ready to surrender
at discretion to him. It is
not the uniform that makes the soldier;
it should be the soldier that
should make the uniform; that is to
say, the kind of dress should be dictated
both by the usual habits and
rank of the wearer, and by the service
he is called on to perform. Add
to this that, provided the men all
wear the same costume, no matter
what it may be, the great end of military
costume, the holding the men in
distinct and united corps, is attained.
The uniform does not make a man
fight a bit the better or worse: it is
only for the sake of evolutions and
discipline that any uniform at all is
needed.</p>

<p>We would therefore recommend the
keeping in view of two principles, in
selecting the uniform of such corps;
viz., utility and simplicity. What
are the duties a rifleman has to perform?
Any man who ever went
deerstalking, any one who is accustomed
to beat up the woods and
covers for cocks or pheasants, knows
nine-tenths of a rifleman's duties.
His game is the enemy: whether he
be a tall stag or a Frenchman, it is
all the same; a steady aim and a
quick finger will do the job for him.
And now, dear reader, or gallant
volunteer, or old fellow-shot, if you
were invited to go a-gunning, whether
after stags, cocks, or men, how would
you like, if left to your own free
choice, apart from all military nonsense&mdash;how
would you like to equip yourself?
We know how we used to go
together over the Inverness-shire hills,
and we know how we now go through
the Herefordshire preserves, and how
we sometimes wander over the Yorkshire
moors; and it is just so that we
should like to turn out. You know
the dress; we need hardly describe
it: everybody knows it; everybody
has worn it. Just such a dress, then,
as the volunteers would wear at home
in their field-sports and occupations,
the very same, or one of the same
kind, would we recommend for their
service as volunteer riflemen.</p>

<p>A shooting-coat, made either of
cloth or velveteen, differing in colour,
perhaps, for the different districts, or
else one and the same throughout the
whole service&mdash;black, or dark brown,
or dark green, or any other colour
that would suit the woodland and the
moor; a waistcoat to match, with
those abundant pockets that the true
shooter knows how to make use of;
trousers and stout boots, or else knee-breeches,
leathern leggings, and high-lows;
in fact, whatever shooting
costume might be decided on by the
gentry and authorities of the county
for their respective regiments. As for
hats, either a plain round hat, or
else one of the soft felt ones, those
most delightful friends to the heated
and exhausted sportsman. The only
thing would be to have everything cut
after the same fashion, and the effect
of uniformity would be immediately
attained, without running into any of
those excesses of paraphernalia which
in former days brought down such
deserved ridicule on the corps of loyal
volunteers. Every man should wear
round his waist a black leathern belt
containing his bullets and leathers;
his caps would be stowed away in one
of his pockets; and his powder would
travel well and dry in a horn or flask
hung by a strap over his shoulder.
His rifle&mdash;we need hardly describe it&mdash;should
be rather longer and heavier
than for sporting purposes, inasmuch
as it may have to be used against
cavalry; and it should admit of having
a sword-bayonet fastened on at
the muzzle. This bayonet might be
worn suspended, as a sword in its
sheath, from the belt round the waist.
A black leathern knapsack, and a
pilot-coat of warm stuff rolled up on
the top of it, would complete the costume
of our volunteer; and he would
look more truly martial and serviceable,
when thus equipped, than if
decked out with all kinds of lace and
trimmings, and clad in a jacket cut in
the most <i>recherché</i> style of military
tailoring.</p>

<p>The officers should wear a precisely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">723</span>
similar dress, but they might be distinguished
by gold or crimson sashes,
according to rank, and might wear
round their breast, or on their hats,
some further distinguishing marks of
their offices. The whole should be
based on the idea of equipping the
corps as plain country gentlemen and
yeomen going out to do a day's serious
business in the field; and if the
business is not to be serious, it is better
to leave it alone than to attempt
it.</p>

<p>Regard should be paid to the various
inclinations and habits of the
districts from whence the regiments
should be drawn, and, in particular,
those from Scotland should by all
means retain some strongly distinctive
marks of their national costume:
the plaid could never be misapplied
on their brawny shoulders.</p>

<p>We should suppose that it would
cost each member of the corps at least
£10 or £15 to equip himself completely,
and this would be by no means
too large a sum for the purposes required.</p>

<p>The costume of the mounted riflemen
need not differ much from that
of the men on foot. The shooting-coat
is as good on horseback as off;
and the only alteration we would
recommend would be in the use of
the stout but supple black-jack hunting-boots
now coming so much into
fashion. These admit of exercise on
foot as well as in the saddle, and being
plain, quiet things, would be
peculiarly suitable for the purpose
intended.</p>

<p>8thly, We are firmly persuaded
that, if this experiment were tried in
any one county or district, it would
be found to answer so well that others
would adopt and imitate it. The service
it would render to government
might be most important in stirring
times; and being a <i>bonâ fide</i> and
really effective corps, it would revive
the martial and manly feelings of the
people, now somewhat blunted by the
long duration of peace, and would
diffuse a most wholesome spirit
throughout the land. From the sentiments
of honour, and loyalty too,
with which such a corps would be
animated, (for it would be composed
of the very flower and hope of the
land,) it would, by its moral
weight alone, keep in check that crowd
of discontented persons who always
exist in our empire. The loyal and
honourable sentiments possessed by
this corps would spread themselves
abroad among the people; the good
example set would be followed by the
most respectable part of the nation,
and a healthier tone would be thereby
given to society in general.</p>

<p>9thly, Taking into consideration the
number of parishes, and the population
of Great Britain, (for we could not admit
the Irish into our loyal ranks) we
should estimate the probable force
that could thus be raised and maintained
at its own expense, at not less
than 50,000 men, of whom 10,000
would be effective light cavalry; and
we should suppose that at least 40,000
of this total number might be counted
on for active service, in any emergency.</p>

<p>The mere fact, if this calculation be
not overrated, of our being thereby
able to add such a degree of strength
to our regular army&mdash;or that of our
being able to replace such a number
of our regular troops, if called abroad
suddenly for distant duty&mdash;or else,
the knowledge that there would always
be such a numerous body of men
in the country, armed and arrayed in
the support of the monarchy and the
constitution; either of these facts,
taken separately, might justify the
formation of such a corps, but, taken
conjointly, they seem to carry with
them no small weight.</p>

<p>An anomaly in the present constitution
of noble society which requires
remedying, is the frequent inadequacy
of the territorial means possessed by
noble families for the maintenance of
their power and dignity. This has
reached to such a pitch, of late days,
that we have seen the ladies of two
peers of the realm claiming public
support <i>in formâ pauperum</i>; and we
have witnessed the breaking-up and
sale of such a princely establishment
as that of Stowe. Many noble families
are forced to depend on public
offices, and other indirect sources, for
the support of their members. Many
noble families of high distinction and
renown are poorer than ordinary commoners.
There are very few estates
of nobles (we say nothing of those of
commoners) which are not oppressed
by mortgages, and which, in reality,
confer much less power than they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">724</span>
nominally represent. From whatever
causes these circumstances may have
arisen,&mdash;whether from the folly and
extravagance of the nobles themselves
as a main cause, or from the
imprudence of the crown in making
unworthy creations, as a subsidiary
cause&mdash;they have produced the most
injurious effects upon the order, and
have even justified the boast of the
first commoner who thought himself
superior to the last of the nobles. By
few things has the order been more
injured in public opinion than by the
inequality and inadequacy of its territorial
resources. This, too, becomes
the more painfully evident in a nation
where commerce has been allowed to
assume an undue preponderance in
the public mind, and where the means
of gaining money are so various and
so many, that the rapid acquisition of
handsome fortunes is a very common
occurrence. It is an evil, a negation
of the ends of life, and a main cause
of the decline and fall of a nation,
that such a state of things should exist;
but, seeing that it does exist, it
is doubly the duty and the interest
of all who have the honour and the
permanency of national prosperity at
heart, to favour the establishment and
the maintenance of the strongest possible
antagonistic principle&mdash;the forming
and preserving of large territorial
possessions in favour of the order of
nobles. Believing that the law of
primogeniture is the basis of all political
freedom, we would urge the expediency
of modifying the law, so that
certain great estates, like the fiefs of
old, should become inalienable by any
person, unattachable for any liabilities,
and indivisible under any circumstances,
in favour of the order of
nobles: and that the holders of such
estates should be nobles, and nobles
only. In the same spirit we would
say, that the extent of territory should
determine the rank of the noble, taking,
as the starting-point, the estates
as they might exist at any period of
time; that to each title a certain territory
should be inalienably attached,
and that the title itself should derive
its name from that territory&mdash;the
holder of the territory, whoever he
might be, always taking the title.
It would be productive of great good
if facilities were given as much as
possible for massing together the properties
of the noble; and if estates
widely spread over the kingdom could
be exchanged for others lying close
together, and forming a compact territory.
The powers of the nobles are
now greatly frittered away and lost
by the dispersion of their properties:
he who holds nearly a whole county
continuously, like the Duke of Sutherland,
is of much more weight in the
state than another, like the Duke of
Devonshire, whose estates, though of
very great value, lie more widely
scattered.</p>

<p>It may appear an innovation, but
we are persuaded that it would be only
a return to the fundamental and ancient
principles of the constitution, to
make the possession of a real estate of
a certain value, for a certain time, a
legal title to claim the right to nobility.
Thus the possession of an estate of
£10,000 per annum clear rental, or
of 5000 acres, by the same family, in
direct descent for four generations,
should of itself constitute a right for
its owner to be ranked in the lowest
order of nobility,&mdash;that of barons,&mdash;and
the barony should give its name
to its possessor; while, the possession
of land of greater extent and value
should modify the superior titles of
those who held them, until the highest
rank in the peerage were attained.
All nobles holding not less than
£100,000 per annum of clear rental, or
50,000 acres, should <i>ipso facto</i> and <i>de
jure</i> become dukes, and so on in proportion
between these two extremes
of the peerage. Baronets should rank,
in virtue of their estates, immediately
after the barons; and in their turn, too,
the possession of a certain income
from landed property, such as £5000
a-year clear for four generations, in
the same family, should immediately
entitle its owner to rank among the
baronets, and to have the style and
privileges of that order.</p>

<p>It will be urged, on the other hand,
that the crown would thereby be deprived
of the power of rewarding meritorious
public servants, by calling
them up to the House of Peers, if the
possession of a certain large amount
of landed property were made a <i>sine
quâ non</i> for every creation. To this
it may be replied that, though the prerogatives
of the crown require extension
rather than contraction, yet that
a sufficient power of reward would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">725</span>
possessed, if men of eminence in the
public service, whether great commanders
or distinguished lawyers,
were summoned to the Upper House
for their lives only, without their titles
being made hereditary; and further,
that other distinctions might be given
which would be fully sufficient rewards
in themselves without any encroachment
being made on the privileges of
the order of nobles. Thus, in former
times, when the honour of knighthood
was not so common as it has now become,
a great general and a great
judge considered themselves rewarded
enough if knighted: they never thought
of being created peers. And the fact
is, that though personal nobility&mdash;the
nobility acquired by the performance
of great actions&mdash;is in itself of the
highest value to the state, as well as
to the individual, it is not sufficiently
valuable to entitle the heirs of a great
man to take perpetual rank among the
great landed proprietors of the realm.
The duties and responsibilities of nobility
depend more upon the trust reposed
in each member than upon that
member's personal qualifications. The
noble cannot be separated from his
lands nor from his tenants, nor from
the multifarious heavy responsibilities
thereby incurred; he is the representative
of a great interest in the state; he
is the representative of his land, and
of all connected with it; he is the representative
of a great class and gathering:
his duties are not merely
personal; he cannot found his right to
nobility upon personal merit alone.
Personal qualifications can give no
valid right to hereditary privileges,
whereas land is perpetual&mdash;<i>rura manebunt</i>&mdash;and
the privileges as well as the
duties attached to it should be perpetual
also.</p>

<p>It would, therefore, be another step
towards constituting the aristocracy
of the state on a more solid and
reasonable basis, if the orders of baronets,
and of knights of various descriptions,
were purified of their anomalies,
and rendered attainable only under
rules of a more general and fixed nature
than at present prevail. Both
these classes of nobles&mdash;for so they
may be called&mdash;require considerable
purification; the former, that of baronet,
should be made the intermediate
class between the nobles by personal
merit, or knights, and those who are
nobles by their lands, the peers. As
was observed before, no baronetcy
should be conferred unless a real estate
of a certain value could be shown to
be possessed, <i>clear</i> of all mortgage and
debt; and the retention of such an
estate for a certain number of generations
should establish a legal claim to
the title of baronet; while the subsequent
increase of the same estate, and
a similar retention of it for a certain
number of descents, should establish
a further claim to the honour of the
peerage. If the orders of knighthood
were made more difficult of entry, and
if they were specially reserved only
for public personal services, they
would rise again in public estimation,
and would be suitable for all purposes
of reward required by the sovereign.</p>

<p>At the same time, and as a consequence
of this, peers and baronets
should not be admitted into the orders
of knighthood&mdash;they should be satisfied
with their own dignities. The
garter, the thistle, and the shamrock
should be reserved especially for the
great military and naval commanders
of the realm: the bath, and perhaps
one or two other new orders, should
be destined for men of eminence in
whatever line of life they might be
able to render service to their country.</p>

<p>It is an opinion controverted by
some, but it seems founded in reason,
that the twelve judges, who are at
the head of their most honourable
profession, should not merely be
allowed to sit on the benches of the
House of Lords, but that they should
have the right of voting therein, and,
in fact, be summoned as peers for
life upon their elevation to the bench.
No order of men in the whole state
would exercise power more conscientiously,
and from no other source could
the Upper House derive at once such
an immense increase of deliberative
strength in the revision and framing
of the laws. The bench of spiritual
lords, and the bench of legal lords,
ought to form two of the purest ornaments
in the bright galaxy of the
peers of the realm.</p>

<p>We shall content ourselves for the
present with indicating two other
points, recognised and admitted by
the constitutional forms of the government,
but at present much lost
sight of; and they may be considered
as affecting the lowest order&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">726</span>
very root of the whole nobility of the
land.</p>

<p>Members of the Lower House for
counties are always called <i>knights</i> of
the shires they represent; and so they
ought to be. No person should be
eligible to represent a county unless
previously adorned with the honour
either of knighthood or of the baronetage,
or unless the younger son of a
peer of the realm; and indeed the
attaching of titles of nobility to the
possession of estates of a certain value
and fixity of tenure, and the annexing
of baronetcies to similar properties,
would put all the principal country
gentlemen in a position suited to the
duties of a knight of the shire. We
should not then see the absurd and
mischievous anomaly of an ambitious
theorist of no landed property in his
own possession, but backed by the
democrats of a manufacturing district,
thrust upon the legislature as the
representative of a large agricultural
county. We should rather find the
knights of the shires forming a compact
and most influential body in the
imperial parliament, the real representatives
of the interests of their
constituents, and the main conservative
element in the Lower House of
the legislature.</p>

<p>The bearing of arms, and the gratuitous
assumption of the title of
esquire, now so universally adopted,
require to be more strictly limited,
unless it is desired that the whole
system should fall from inevitable
ridicule into ultimate disuse. It is a
kind of morbid feeling that has thus
been produced by national vanity,
and will some day or other work out
its opposite extreme, unless restrained
in due time. For the undue granting
of arms the Herald's College is greatly
responsible; but for the universal
assumption of the correlative title,
society at large is to be blamed. It
is one of the weaknesses of the day,
that men and things are no longer
called by their true names, and it
indicates a downward progress in the
national fortunes rather than the
contrary. The evil might be checked
by the confining of the right to wear
<i>coats</i> of arms or <i>shields</i> to the orders
of knighthood only&mdash;as it used to be
at the first institution of the custom;
while for all persons under that standing
in society, some distinctive badge
or family token might be adopted,
sufficient to identify their lineage, yet
showing a difference of grade. It is
more difficult to say how the appellations
of the various classes of commoners
shall be settled; but there can
be no doubt that the common herding
of all men together&mdash;whether under
the names of esquires, gentlemen, or
even of "gents"&mdash;is an absurdity:
mischievous, inasmuch as it tends to
level what ought to be unequal, and
as it renders ridiculous what ought to
be respected.</p>

<p>We readily allow that the ideas
propounded above are more or less
Utopian; so, however, are all ideas
of change. With this excuse, however,
we content ourselves for the
present. If we have advocated any
amendments, they are not in the direction
of what is called, falsely
enough&mdash;<i>Progress</i>, but in that of
what is really and truly improvement,
because it implies a reverting
to the fundamental and unalterable
basis of the modern European
social system. "Progress" now
means advancement in the cause of
democracy&mdash;that is, in the path which
marks the decline and fall, and ultimate
destruction of any old nation.
Far be it from us to lend a hand to
aught that can assist this fatal and
destructive process. We would preserve,
and restore, and improve, rather
than destroy. And it is because we
believe this ancient spirit of feudalism
to be that which contains the great
elements of national prosperity, that
we therefore advocate a return towards
some of its first principles. A
further development of this we reserve
for a future occasion. But this we
will maintain, that in the great cycle
of years which constitute the life of a
people, the upward rising of the nation
is characterised by the active
vitality of what we will call feudalism,
its downward sinking by the existence
of democratic license and opulent
enervation, following upon the decline
of warlike and chivalrous pursuits.
The process of corruption and
of disintegration may be slow, but it is
not the less certain. It overtakes
even the most prosperous nations at
last. Would that we could check and
avert that evil from our own country!

<h2 id="CIVIL_REVOLUTION_IN_THE_CANADAS">CIVIL REVOLUTION IN THE CANADAS.</h2>

<p>Strange though it sound to speak
of a revolution in these provinces,
where the representative of the crown
is notoriously supported by a large
majority in the provincial parliament,
and where, for years past, there has
scarcely been an inquiry made as to
when a regiment either came or went,
or even how many troops were in the
whole American colonies; yet it is
nevertheless a fact, that a more important
and effective revolution is
now going on in the Canadas, than if
half their population were in open
arms against the mother country.</p>

<p>Before attempting either to describe
or to account&mdash;which we trust in the
course of this paper to be able to do&mdash;for
this extraordinary state of
things, it will be necessary to touch
upon a few leading events in the history
of both provinces, and, incidentally,
upon the character and intentions
of the parties engaged in them.</p>

<p>It is well known to all English
readers, that the French of Lower
Canada, forming a population of some
four hundred thousand people, after a
long course of factious and embarrassing
legislation; after a species of
civil, social, and parliamentary strife
for nearly half a century, which was
far more withering in its effects upon
the prosperity of the country than a
good fight in the beginning would have
been, finally, in 1837, took up arms
against the British government. Shortly
afterwards they were joined by the
party in Upper Canada which had long
made common cause with them,
though without common principles,
aims, or hopes&mdash;the one's pride being
indissolubly wedded to institutions
which were pregnant with retrogression
and decay, the other's chief merit
consisting in pretension to raise men
from beneath old ruins, instead of
bringing old ruins down upon them.
Yet both agreed in hating England,
and in taking up arms, jointly and
severally, to overthrow her institutions.
Whatever other lesson England
might have learned from the
fact, she should at least have learned
this&mdash;that it was no ordinary feelings
of desperation or of difference that
made them forego so much to each
other, in order to strike an effectual
blow at her; and that it could
be no ordinary circumstance, if it
was even in the nature of things,
after they had become partners in
the same defeats and humiliations&mdash;after
they had been made bed-fellows
by the same misfortunes&mdash;that could
disunite them in favour of their common
enemy; and not only turn the tide of their
hatred against each other, but
make the party that became loyal to
England kiss the rod that had so
severely scourged it.</p>

<p>Probably this might have been
thought difficult. But where the hostility
to England might have been regarded
as accidental, rather than of
settled and determined principle, it
might be urged that the reconciling
one or both these parties to the British
government, might not have been
impossible; or the bringing the one
back to loyalty, even at the expense
of its having to oppose the other, might
still be in the power of wise legislation.</p>

<p>This brings us to consider the character
and the principles, the prejudices
and the predilections, of the two
parties. And if the reader will follow
us over a little scrap of history, possibly
new to him, if we do not happen
to differ on the road, we apprehend
we shall agree in summing up the
general results.</p>

<p>For many parliaments previous to
the rebellion in Lower Canada, the
majority in favour of the French was
on an average equal to four-fifths of
each house. And, instead of this
majority being diminished by the
agency of immigration, or by reason
of the detachment of almost every
Englishman and American in the
province from their cause&mdash;who at
first sided with them for the purpose
of procuring the redress of all
real abuses, most, if not all, of
which, arose from the nature of their
own institutions,&mdash;it continued to increase,
until at last every county in
the province which had a preponderance
of French influence, sent a
member to parliament to carry on a
kind of civil war with the government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">728</span>
Men of the first talents in the
country, who had freely spent the best
of their lives and their efforts in its
service, when they were compelled to
leave this faction, or take leave of
their loyalty to the crown, found that
the breadth of their own intellects was
all they were ever able to detach
from its ranks. Every concession the
imperial government could make,
every effort to conciliate them, was
met only by fresh demands&mdash;demands
conceived in a spirit of hostility,
and wilfully and knowingly
of such a character as could not be
conceded. Yet their majorities continued,
and even increased, in parliament.
In 1832, they carried their
measures of hostility to the British,
and even the Irish population so far, as
to refuse to employ them for any purposes
whatever, and, in some cases,
those employed were dismissed. It
is matter of Lower Canadian history,
that one of their greatest grievances
was, that they had not the control of
the appointments of judges and other
public officers, and the apportioning
of their salaries; yet it is well known&mdash;it
was publicly avowed by them in
Parliament&mdash;that their object was, to
starve out the British government, by
starving out its officers. Still the
French leaders who mooted these
measures gained in popularity, and
the English members for French
counties continued to lessen. British
manufactures were solemnly denounced
in their parliament, and the
use of them declared a disgrace to
every Frenchman; and a tax, which
they intended as a prohibition, was attempted
to be placed upon British
emigrants: yet withal, Mr Papineau,
the great French leader, rose the
higher, and his party grew the stronger.
The more, in short, the French leaders
could embarrass the government,
and the more they could throw obstacles
in the way of the improvements
incident to the activity and enterprise
of the English race, the more they
rose in the estimation of the French
constituencies. They claimed, in
truth, for these very acts, their confidence,
and they received what they
claimed to the fullest extent. In a well-written,
and, considering all the circumstances,
a temperate address of
the Constitutional Association of
Montreal in 1832&mdash;an association
got up with the view of making the
situation of the British population
known to the imperial government,
and an association that afterwards
greatly contributed to save the province
during the rebellion&mdash;we find
the following among other passages to
the same effect, upon this subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For half a century has the population
of English and Irish descent in Lower
Canada been subjected to the domination
of a party whose policy has been to retain
the distinguishing attributes of a
foreign race, and to crush in others that
spirit of enterprise which they are unable
or unwilling to emulate. During this
period, a population, descended from the
same stock with ourselves, have covered
a continent with the monuments of their
agricultural industry. Upper Canada
and the United States bear ample testimony
of the flood-tide of prosperity&mdash;the
result of unrestricted enterprise, and of
equitable laws. Lower Canada, where
another race predominates, presents a
solitary exception to this march of improvement.
There, surrounded by forests
inviting industry, and offering a rich
reward to labour, an illiterate people,
opposed to improvements, have compressed
their growing numbers almost
within the boundaries of their original
settlements, and present, in their mode
of laws, in their mode of agriculture,
and peculiar customs, a not unfaithful
picture of France in the seventeenth
century. There also may be witnessed
the humiliating spectacle of a
rural population not unfrequently necessitated
to implore eleemosynary relief
from the legislature of the country."</p></blockquote>

<p>But it is no new lesson to learn,
that an inert and unprogressive race,
with pride clinging to decay, and
customs withering to enterprise, cannot
harmonise, in legislative provisions,
with men who want laws to assist
the steps of advancing civilisation,
rather than ways and means of keeping
up old ruins; who prefer to gather
the fruits of a thousand trees, for
the planting of which enterprise
has explored, and industry has employed,
new and rich domains, to
tying up the decaying branches of a
few old ones, to which possibly memory
may love to cling, but under which
plain human nature might starve.
To expect, in fact, that men with
such opposite characteristics, apart
even from their other elements of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">729</span>
discord, should harmonise, when the
party weaker in legislation was the
stronger in civilisation, when the
party that stood still had the power
of making the other stand still also,
was to expect an impossibility. And
this was exactly the nature of the
contest so long carried on in Lower
Canada. An ox and a race-horse had
been yoked together in the same legislative
harness. But the misfortune
was increased by the race-horse's
being subject&mdash;however much he
might struggle, and rear, and foam&mdash;to
the motions of his dogged companion,
and to the necessity of not
moving at all, whenever it pleased
his venerable mate to stand still. It
is clear, therefore, that any legislative
provision, after the rebellion, which
would restore to the French this
ascendency, would be but causing
confusion worse confused&mdash;would be
but entailing upon both parties constant
contentions, with the probability,
if not the certainty, of a final
appeal to arms; in which case England
would be left without a friend in
either party&mdash;the one looking upon
her as their natural enemy&mdash;the other
as a power which had always sacrificed
its friends when it had the
means of benefiting them&mdash;had perpetually
raised its defenders very
high, to see how very far it could let
them fall.</p>

<p>The party in Upper Canada which
had opposed the government step by
step, until it ended with rebellion
in conjunction with the French,
was composed of vastly different
materials from these its allies. And
it is somewhat singular, but it is
nevertheless a fact, that this party,
both as to its strength, and the true
causes of its hostility to England, has
never been very thoroughly understood
even in the Canadas. The principle
of under-rating enemies was always
applied to it by its opponents in the
province. The pernicious habit of
looking upon men with too much
contempt to take the measure of their
strength, is as bad in politics as it is
in a physical struggle. But the
party known as the government party
in Upper Canada, was generally
far too self-important and too great
to calculate how many dark-looking
clouds it takes to make a storm.
The government of England too,
never very clear-sighted in colonial affairs,
and with its Argus eye as directed
to Canadian prospects always suffering
from some defect of vision, or
looking through very distorting media,
was not very likely to catch the height
and cut of each individual in a colonial
multitude, which it scarcely ever saw
even in gross; while the Governors
who "did the monarch" in the province,
did not generally betray much
taste for sitting down by the farmer's
fireside, and eating apple-sauce and
sauerkraut at his table, where there
neither was, nor could have been,
recognised a distinction between the
master and the man,&mdash;between the
lord of the castle and the cook in the
kitchen. Yet such were the places
where governors and rulers might
have seen at work the elements of
democracy; might have witnessed
the process of education to the levelling
system. An education which,
with the vast facilities for independence
in America, irrespective of
situation or institutions&mdash;men never
get over; and in which they might
have traced the natural growth of
feelings and principles, that must,
in the very nature of things, be in a
state of continual warfare with the
customs, the pride, and the love of
distinction, which are the inalienable
offspring of the monarchy, the aristocracy,
and the social system of
England. Yet here they never penetrated
either to count the voters or
the children. They felt&mdash;they were
obliged to feel&mdash;that the great wheel
of the government, which was the
majority in parliament, often performed
extraordinary revolutions the
wrong way. But they knew not how
or wherefore. They never went where
they might have studied, and could
have understood, the difficulty; where,
to make a long story short, in order
to get at what they missed, and to
understand what they did not, the
reader has possibly anticipated the
necessity of accompanying us.</p>

<p>From the circumstances attending
the early settlement of Upper Canada,
and from the character of the early
settlers themselves, the preachers of
the Methodist denomination were not
merely almost the only preachers
they had for many years an opportunity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">730</span>
of hearing, but were, of all
others, those they most desired to
hear. The clergymen of the Church
of England were few, and stationed
in the larger towns. But it is
one of the peculiarities of Methodism,
that however numerous or
scattered the settlers might have
been, the preacher could always
manage to live among them; for he
received with his circuit a sort of universal
billeting-ticket, and the houses
of all his flock, and all his flock's
friends, thereupon became one vast
home to him; and wherever he happened
to take up his temporary abode,
he conferred a sort of honour instead
of receiving a favour. The system
had another peculiarity too&mdash;at all
events, at the early period we are speaking
of&mdash;it had no standard of fitness in
the way of education for its ministry.
Yet where men of education could
never think of penetrating or existing,
these men were willing to go.
Where no bishop could dream of
sending a pastor, it is the principle
of Methodism to believe the Lord will
raise up or send one. If his talents
are none of the brightest, they are willing
to trust to Heaven to make up
the deficiency; and certainly, in some
instances, there is much need of it.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to perceive how
great must have been the influence of
these preachers over a people so circumstanced:
how eagerly&mdash;in the
absence of newspapers, and of nearly
every means of learning what was
going on in the province, much less
in the affairs of the world&mdash;the leading
characters of the neighbourhoods
gathered round the preacher, after
the meeting was over, at the fireside
of some brother of the Church, to
hear the latest news, to get the last
newspaper or pamphlet, and to receive
his oracular opinions upon the
measures and the men agitating the
country. And in two-thirds of the
districts in the province, these preachers
had for years, unopposed and unquestioned,
those opportunities of
instilling a political education&mdash;which,
if they chose to make use of them,
would enable them to plant a crop,
whether of good or of evil, for or
against the institutions of England,
wholly, uneradicable,&mdash;were there
even the same opportunities afforded
of eradicating it that there were of
sowing it.</p>

<p>For five successive parliaments in
Upper Canada, previous to the rebellion,
each party had alternately the
majority in the house&mdash;the one party
being known as the Tory or Family
Compact; the other as the Radical or
the Saddle-bag faction&mdash;a name more
truthfully than elegantly applied to
it, on account of its owing its majority
to the exertions of these same
Methodist preachers in its favour;
and from their mode of travelling
through the country being on horseback,
with large saddle-bags swung
on each side of the nag, and, by
way of adding to the picturesque,
with a leathern valise strapped on immediately
over his tail. These bags
and valise, it was alleged by their
opponents, were always filled&mdash;with,
we suppose, the necessary exception of
stowage for hymn-books, and the
other paraphernalia of their craft&mdash;with
papers and pamphlets against the monarchy,
the Church, and the institutions
of England, and in favour of the
democracy of the States. But whether
the bags and valise were so filled or
not; or whether, indeed, these
preachers, at this early period, had it
in their power to treat their friends
to as many pamphlets, and papers,
and almanacs&mdash;for the last was and is
a method of disseminating political
opinions much resorted to in America&mdash;as
they were accused of, we shall not
undertake to determine. This, however,
we certainly can assert&mdash;that if
we had out of the whole world to select
the most perfect embodiment of the
spirit of hostility to all the pomp, and
pride, and distinction, and deference to
rank, incident to monarchy, wherever
it may exist, we should select these
same Methodist preachers. Educated,
for the most part, in the United States,
or in Canada by American schoolmasters;
with their conferences held
in the States; the seat of their church
in the States; their ministers ordained
in the States; their bishops
sent from there&mdash;for they were all,
at this time, Episcopal Methodists&mdash;and
the great body of their church
flourishing there,&mdash;they imbibed, from
the very beginning, American feelings
of hostility to the established Church
of England, and to the pride and love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">731</span>
of distinction&mdash;to all the characteristics
which must exhibit themselves
wherever English society has a footing,
and England's monarchy a representative.
Hostility to these was,
in truth, the very genius of their religion.
Looked upon with contempt
by Episcopal clergymen, they took a
pious revenge in wildly declaiming
against the pride and arrogance of
those who derided them, and incidentally
pointed to the luxurious
grandeur and sumptuous living of the
great dignitaries of the church, while
its poor hard-working curates had
scarcely the means of living. Treated
with contumely by the few educated
English who, from time to time,
settled among their hearers, they
pointed in their indignation to that
country, and to those institutions,
where one man was held no better
than another, and where the many
could soon level the pride and bring
down the pretensions of the few.
Deprived by law, as they were at this
time, of nearly all the rights of Christian
ministers&mdash;of the right to marry,
and all similar ones, (for both the
government and the church had long
contended against men whom they
regarded and believed, in point of
education and character, to be wholly
unfit to exercise these sacred functions,)
they declaimed from the very
bottom of their hearts against the
illiberality and exclusiveness of English
institutions, of English feelings,
and of English pride, in depriving
them of these rights; and they applauded,
with equal earnestness, that
government under which their church
flourished, in the fullest exercise of
the widest privileges of a Christian
denomination. There is no exaggeration
on the one side or on the other
in this. It would be offensive to the
church and to its adherents to say,
that they regarded these preachers
otherwise than we have described. It
would be unjust to the Methodists to
say, that they did not feel, and that
they did not act, as we have given them
credit for doing.</p>

<p>But in addition to the effect, political
and national, produced by these
preachers, the peculiarity of the Methodist
church-government spread the
same influences by many minor, but
not less effectual ramifications. Every
little society, in every neighbourhood,
had what is called a class-leader, or
local preacher, whose duty it was to
exercise a sort of half-religious and
half-civil domination over the part of
the church immediately surrounding
him, to give them advice, settle their
differences, and practise the arts of small
oratory and miniature government.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to perceive how
this system must have furnished a
leader to every little neighbourhood;
how the ambition first formed by a
class-meeting must have wished the
larger sphere of a political one; and
how the consciousness of ability to
govern a congregation naturally led
to the conviction that the same abilities
might be usefully employed in
the magistracy, or even in parliament.
And it is a significant fact, that since
the friends of these class-leaders have
been in power, in every neighbourhood
where the Methodists have had a
footing, two-thirds of the magistrates
appointed by the government were,
and are, these very class-leaders themselves.
But, at the time we are speaking
of, the idea of appointing a person
a magistrate, whose only qualification
consisted in his exhibiting a stentorian
voice at Methodist meetings, or being
an influential member of "his society,"
was utterly repugnant to the feelings
of men educated to dislike such persons,
even when they are unpretending,
much less when they aspire to
offices of honour and distinction.
No class-leaders, therefore, in neighbourhoods
where every man was
alike a lord of the soil, saw themselves
looked up to as leaders by
the many, at the same time that they
were looked down upon as boorish
pretenders by the few. But what
galled them yet more was, that they
constantly saw the few placed in
offices of honour and emolument over
them, and thus "rubbing in," as they
termed it, the insult and the injustice
of their own exclusion. Like the
preachers, too, they pointed, in their
indignation and revenge, to that country
and those institutions where the
people could raise the man, and not
the crown&mdash;where they could not only
attain what they aimed at, but crush
what they abhorred.</p>

<p>Partly from this system of religious
and political education, and partly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_732">732</span>
from the great number of Americans
who settled in the province immediately
after the revolutionary war,
and who came in with, and at the
suggestion of Governor Simcoe, as well
as the many who came in without
him&mdash;but mainly from the tinge of
nationality that all large communities
impart to small ones adjacent to them&mdash;the
manners, the customs, the accent,
and even the prejudices, of the rural
native population in Upper Canada,
are scarcely distinguishable from the
American. Their very slang words are
the same, and their dislike of what they
term "blooded critters,"&mdash;namely,
Englishmen, who cannot help evincing
their inveterate dislike of either associating
themselves, or allowing their
families to associate, with persons
whose education and habits they consider
beneath them. Every feature,
indeed, by which an Englishman can
detect the influence of the levelling system
in the States, particularly among
the farming and lower classes, he can
also detect, and fully to the same
extent, among all the American, the
Dutch, and most of the rural native
Canadian population in Upper Canada.
It would be digressing too far from
the main object of this paper to bring
forward examples&mdash;and we know hundreds&mdash;where
English gentlemen have
been subjected to innumerable petty annoyances,
(such as cutting down their
fences, and letting the cattle into their
corn-fields,) merely because it became
hinted about the neighbourhoods
where they had settled that they were
"blooded critters," and refused to eat
at the same table with their labourers,
and associate upon an equal footing
with their neighbours, irrespective of
their habits, character, and education;
where men have left the harvest-fields
as soon as they discovered that two
tables were set in the house; and
where families have been obliged, to
avoid inconveniences that could not
be endured, to conform, if not altogether,
at least for a time, to the general
usage of admitting no distinction
between master and man. It must
suffice for our purpose now, to say
that these things exist&mdash;that they
exist to the extent that we have described
them; and without going into
the question of the policy or the impolicy
of Englishmen not conforming
to the general and prevailing customs
of the country in which they settle, or
of the merit or demerit of these customs
themselves, all we wish to say here is,
that these customs are, in our humble
opinion, inimical to all monarchical
education&mdash;to that state of society
where rank must be recognised, respectability
distinguished, and refinement
preserved, or monarchy cease to
exist, or become a mockery.</p>

<p>But what was the strength of all
these natural and unmistakable elements
of hostility to monarchy under
any form, and to a people bred under
monarchical institutions in any circumstances?
What was the power
of the Methodists, in so far as that
was used against the government,
over the constituencies of the province?
What was the power of those
who were not Methodists, but who
united with them in opposing the
government? And what was the power
of the really honest Yankees in the
province, who never hesitated to
avow that they hated the British
government, root, branches, and
all? And in what way did their
united feelings and intentions develop
themselves?</p>

<p>For upwards of a quarter of a century
they maintained,&mdash;with all the
power and patronage of the government
against them; with most of the
talent born in the province, and the
whole, or very nearly so, of that imported
into it, against them; and with
seven-eighths, yes, nine-tenths, of the
emigrants who were able to purchase
property when they came, or who subsequently
became voters, against them,&mdash;alternate,
and more than alternate, majorities
in parliament. It can answer no
good purpose now, it never answered
any, to deny or to disguise this fact.
This class of men formed, as what we
have already stated must have satisfied
the reader, fully two-thirds of the
electors in the counties. In the Home
District, where M'Kenzie, who headed
the rebellion in 1837, had absolute
control over the elections; in the
Midland District, where Mr Bidwell,
an American by birth, by education,
and from principle, exercised a similar
influence; in the London District,
where Duncombe, who also headed
the rebels, could carry any man into
parliament he pleased; what was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">733</span>
the character of the voters in the
townships and counties which gave
them this power? They were the
Methodists, educated as we have
described; they were the Americans
and Dutch, with strong predilections
in favour of democracy, and still
stronger dislike of the natural and
inevitable characteristics of society
which arise from monarchy itself.
In the Gore district, in the Niagara
district, and in the Newcastle district,
what do the poll-books exhibit for the
counties which sent member after
member, with hardly an exception, to
support M'Kenzie in the parliament,
and some of them to support him in
the rebellion? The number of Hezekiahs,
and Jedediahs, and Jonathans,
of Eliacums, and Ezekiels, shows pretty
clearly what was their origin, and
what were their political predilections.
But these democratic leanings
were by no means arbitrarily confined
to names, for there was both a
Duke of Wellington and a Horatio
Nelson in the Gore District gaol for
treason in 1838. The Duke was a
preacher, and regularly held forth to
his fellow prisoners, until the scamp
at last&mdash;we suppose to acquire a practical
idea of the nature of sin&mdash;stole a
watch from one of his companions,
and was thereupon regularly deposed
from his high calling; and the scene
of his labours changed from among the
political offenders down to the petty
larceny fraternity. All of which may
be found duly chronicled in the records
of the sheriff's office of the Gore District
for the period.</p>

<p>But there is no circumstance, perhaps,
that we could mention, that could
convey a better idea of the relative
regard for England and the United
States, of the class of people we have
been describing, than the fact&mdash;well
known to every person who has lived
among them&mdash;that a Yankee schoolmaster,
without either education or
intelligence&mdash;with nothing on earth
to recommend him, save an inveterate
propensity for vapouring and
meddling in the affairs, religious and
political, of every sect and class
wherever he goes&mdash;can, and ever has,
exercised more influence among them
in a few months, than a whole
neighbourhood of English gentlemen
could in years. And we speak
neither from hearsay nor conjecture:
we speak from what we have seen and
know, and what is susceptible of full
proof.</p>

<p>The political measures of this party,
like all others, soon shaped themselves
into an embodiment of their motives
and principles, and into a means, the
most natural and the most certain, of
gaining and keeping power. Ambition,
mounted between two saddle-bags,
upon a jog-trot pony, was not
likely to shine in the character of a
courtier. A strong nasal accent, and
a love of the levelling system, were
but poor recommendations to English
gentlemen, and English governors, for
offices of distinction and the command
of her Majesty's militia forces. But
both were powerful at the hustings.
What they could not win from the
crown they could gain from the electors.
What monarchical feelings and
a monarchical education could not
brook, democratic voters would assuredly
elevate. The consequences were
such as may be conceived. Their
measures became, to all intents and
purposes, democratic. They began
by requiring, as indispensable to the
proper "image and transcript," as
they called it, of the British constitution,
that the legislative council&mdash;analogous
to the House of Lords&mdash;should
be rendered elective; that the magistracy
should be made elective; that
voting by ballot, as it is practised in
the States, should be introduced; and
that every officer in the country, from
a colonel to a constable, should be
chosen by the people. How much of
monarchy would have been left after
all this&mdash;how many of the distinguishing
characteristics that the English government
imparts to a British people,
would have been discernible, after all
these measures were in full operation,
it would not have been very difficult
to foresee.</p>

<p>Lord Durham, in speaking of this
party, and of that which opposed it,
observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At first sight it appears much more
difficult to form an accurate idea of the
state of Upper than of Lower Canada. The
visible and broad line of demarcation
which separates parties, by the distinctive
characters of race, happily has no existence
in Upper Canada. The quarrel is
one of an entirely English, if not British,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">734</span>
population. Like all such quarrels, it
has, in fact, created not two but several
parties, each of which has some objects
in common with some one of those
to which it is opposed. They differ on
one point and agree on another; the sections
which unite together one day are
strongly opposed the next; and the very
party which acts as one against a common
opponent, is in truth composed of divisions
seeking utterly different or incompatible
objects. It is very difficult to
make out, from the avowals of parties, the
real objects of their struggles; and still
less easy is it to discover any cause of
such importance as would account for its
uniting any large mass of the people in
an attempt to overthrow, by forcible
means, the existing form of government."</p></blockquote>

<p>There could not have been anything
more mischievously incorrect, or more
likely to lead to unfortunate conclusions,
than these statements. We
can safely challenge the whole parliamentary
history of the province, the
character of the leading measures and
of the leading men, and the result of
every election, for twenty-five years,
to find even a reasonable pretext for
them, although we believe they were
made in full conviction of their truth by
the nobleman who made them. Of
course, he could not have properly
understood what he was writing about.
For six successive elections previous
to the rebellion, the whole history of
England does not afford an example
of each party's going to the hustings
with so little change in men, measures,
principles, or feelings, as in
every one of these. In every new
House of Assembly the same identical
leaders, and the same followers, singled
out the same men four years after
four years; and neither accidents nor
changes, the reproaches of treason on
the one side, or the accusations of corruption
on the other, caused the loss of
a man to one party or the gain of one
to the other. The whole heart, soul,
and hopes of the two parties were as
distinct and opposite as those of any
two parties that ever had an existence.
Nor could it have been otherwise, when
the tendencies of the one were so manifestly
against the existence of a
fabric, which every feeling of the other
urged them to preserve at all hazards
and under all circumstances.</p>

<p>At last an important event in the
history of the province brought the
contest between these parties to an
issue. When Sir Francis Head assumed
the government in 1836, he
found the party which had opposed it
for so many years with a large majority
in Parliament. With the view, if possible,
of reconciling the two parties,
and of getting both to unite with him
in furthering the real interests of the
province, he formed an executive
council of the leaders of both. But
the council had scarcely been formed,
before the leaders of the party which
had been so perpetually in opposition
declined remaining in it, unless Sir
Francis would surrender up to them,
practically, the same powers that are
enjoyed by the ministry in England.
This he neither could nor would do.
An angry correspondence ensued.
They significantly pointed, in the
event of the character of the struggle
being changed, to aid from the great
democracy of America. He asserted
that the great right arm of England
should be wielded, if necessary, to
support the crown. They finally concluded
by stopping the supplies. He
dissolved the house.</p>

<p>In the election contest which ensued,
it was distinctly and emphatically
declared by the government, that
the contest was no longer as between
party and party in a colony, but as
between monarchy and democracy in
America. Monarchy was, in fact and
in truth, the candidate at the election.
And whether the whole of the party
engaged in this desperate opposition
participated in the declaration made
to Sir Francis, that they would look
for aid to the States, and which elicited
from him the reply, "Let them
come if they dare," is not a matter
that they have ever enlightened the
public upon. But that he was forced
and obliged to make monarchy the
candidate in this election, or let democracy
threaten and bully him out
of the country, is a historical fact,
and incontrovertible in the Canadas,
but most grossly and most unfortunately
misunderstood in England.</p>

<p>The government party gained the
election. But after the contest, the
opposition, seeing their hopes of success&mdash;which
were founded upon the
plan of embarrassing the government
into their measures, by gaining majorities
in parliament and stopping the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">735</span>
supplies&mdash;all destroyed by the result of
this election; and knowing that immigration
was every year adding to the
strength of their opponents, finally
determined to change the struggle from
the hustings and the parliament, to
the camp and the battle-field&mdash;to risk
all in a bold attempt to strike down
the oak at a blow, instead of attempting
to destroy it, branch by branch, by
democratic measures and factious
legislation. That there were men of
this party who did not approve of this
desperate step, and that there were
others who thought it premature, we believe
and know; but that the great
body of the party itself sympathised
with the leaders in it, and would have
gloried in, and contributed by all the
means in their power to their success,
had it been attainable, we are not
only sure of, but could prove by the
history of the whole affair, given by
those who had the best means of
understanding it.</p>

<p>When Lord Durham arrived in
Canada, he found this party in the
situation of masses of threatening, but
scattered clouds. Some had voluntarily
withdrawn to the States; others
were there, either to escape arrest,
or from consciousness of their guilt
in the rebellion. The great body
of the party remained in the province,
with all those feelings towards
England and her loyalists, that
humbled pride, many sufferings, a
contemptible struggle, and a mortifying
defeat, were likely to engender.
But though the storm had passed
over, the clouds were nearly all left.
The party had, in reality, gained by
experience much more than it had
lost in numbers. It had come to the
understanding that England's great
right arm could not be so easily
broken. It had learned, and its friends
in the States had learned&mdash;what was
most useful to both under the circumstances&mdash;that
if England's institutions
were to be destroyed in America, it
must be done by some other means
than by blows and bayonets.</p>

<p>And it was with this party, thus
situated, and composed of the materials,
and influenced by the considerations,
we have mentioned, that Lord
Durham proposed, by a union of the
provinces, to neutralise the legislative
influence of the French of Lower
Canada&mdash;to destroy their supremacy,
which was pregnant with rebellion,
and to subvert their power, which had
been synonymous with decay. For
without the aid of this party, or a great
portion of it, the loyalists could not accomplish
this; much less could it ever be
accomplished if this party should happen
to unite with the French. A vast
power, too, whether for good or for
evil, and hitherto unknown in a colony,
was thrown among them all to
be scrambled for. We mean a power
analogous to that of the ministry in
England, and known by the name of
a Responsible Government in Canada.
This power, always held in England
by the heads of great parties&mdash;by
men of lofty intellects and great characters&mdash;by
men who were literally invested
with the moral worth, the intelligence,
the rank, and the honour
of millions&mdash;this mighty power was
tossed up in the Canadas like a cap in a
crowd, to fall upon the head of whomsoever
it might chance. It mattered
not whether it was a Frenchman, the
dearest object of whose existence was
the destruction of England's power,
that gained the majority. The cap
must be his. It mattered not whether
it was a democrat, whose secret but
highest aim was the annihilation of
England's monarchy, that succeeded
at the elections: the mantle of England's
honour, and of upholding England's
crown in America, must fall
upon him. We should be sorry to propose
the curtailment of a single privilege
of a single Briton, in any part of
the world where the flag of his country
waves over him. In what we shall
have to say hereafter as to the government
of the colonies, we do not intend
doing so. But what we mean to say of
this vast power, which was thrown
among the people to be scrambled for
at this time in the Canadas, is,
that what in England must have been,
from the very nature of things, a
guarantee for all orders in the state
being preserved and protected under
it, was in the Canadas, equally from
the nature of things, precisely the reverse.
No ministry in England could
be formed without the nobility, the
gentry, the wealth&mdash;all that owed its
all to the preservation of the institutions
of the country&mdash;being represented
in it. In the Canadas a ministry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">736</span>
could be&mdash;yes, from the very nature
of things, a ministry must be&mdash;formed,
where Frenchmen, who hated England&mdash;where
democrats, who hated
monarchy, must control the destinies
of England's subjects&mdash;the existence
of England's empire in the west. We
would not be understood, therefore,
as desiring to curtail a single privilege;
but we would, nevertheless, keep edge-tools
out of the hands of madmen and
enemies. We would not remove the
rope from the neck of another to put
it round our own.</p>

<p>Extraordinary though it seem that
human credulity could go so far&mdash;if
the character of the parties, if the
character even of the measures of the
parties, in Upper Canada was understood&mdash;as
to expect that the giving to
the one which had opposed the government,
as it were by nature, the power,
by uniting with the French, of crushing
its enemies for ever, that it would
not do so; that it would not join with
its old allies in dividing the spoils of
prosperity, as it had already done in
sharing the mortifications of defeat;
that it would not join them, even for
the purpose of having revenge, each of
its own enemy in its own province;&mdash;yet
such was the hope, such the infatuation
of Lord Durham. He let a
little stream of abstract right fall into
a whole sea of French prejudices and
democratic infatuations, and he expected
that it would change the great
face of the waters. And what has
been the result?&mdash;that the little
stream has been lost in the great sea;
that, instead of its changing the sea,
it has but added to its weight; that
all the prejudices, all the infatuations
are left; and the power that was expected
to change them has been converted
into tools for them to work with.</p>

<p>Up to the last election, the French
had never fairly recovered their former
influence, or rather had not the
opportunity of fully exerting their
powers in the elections. Up to the
same period, the reform party, as they
styled themselves in Upper Canada,
had laboured under a similar disadvantage.
The latter had suffered for
the want of its leaders, three of whom
were outlaws in the States, as well
as from other causes. But at the
last election&mdash;a fair one for all parties&mdash;the
French recovered all their former
power, and the Upper Canadian
party all its former counties. The
French, therefore, were making all
the strides they could towards the
domination that, according to Lord
Durham, was pregnant with rebellion;
the reform party had just the opportunity
that he fondly wished for them,
of checking the evil, and of establishing
an enlightened and moderate
British party between the two extremes.
And what did they do?
The measures and the facts must speak
for themselves.</p>

<p>The following resolution, moved by
Mr Lafontaine, attorney-general for
Lower Canada, taken in the abstract,
would seem harmless and fair
enough:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Resolved, that this house do now resolve
itself into a committee to take into
consideration the necessity of establishing
the amount of losses incurred by certain
inhabitants of Lower Canada during the
<i>political troubles</i> of 1837 and 1838, and of
providing for the payment thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p>But when the following commentary
of items, intended to be paid
under it, is added to it, the nature of
the <i>political troubles</i> of 1837 and 1838,
and the intention of the resolution,
will be better understood:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That this flagitious calendar of
charges was deliberately intended to
be paid by her Majesty's Canadian
ministry, it may probably be more
satisfactory to the reader to establish
by the testimony of that ministry itself,
than by any statements of our own.</p>

<p>Mr Merritt, the president of the
council, and occupying a similar position
in the government of Canada
that Lord John Russell does in the
government of England, thus writes
to his constituents, who had addressed
him on the subject, and remonstrated
against paying these charges:&mdash;"On
becoming a member of the government
(he was appointed president of
the council upon Mr Sullivan's being
raised to the bench, a short time before
the meeting of parliament) <i>I
found their payment determined on by
the administration</i>." The reader will
observe, that it was against the payment
of the items above quoted, that
Mr Merritt's constituents remonstrated.
He answered, that their payment
was decided upon before he took office.
But he continues:&mdash;"My first impression
was, I confess, against it;
but I soon became convinced that they
had no alternative. I neither wish to
be misunderstood, nor relieved from
responsibility. Although the government
approved of Mr Boulton's amendment,
[which was an amendment of
its own resolution,] which excludes
those who were sent to Bermuda, I
was prepared to vote for excluding
none." That is to say,&mdash;Mr Merritt
had the manliness to risk his character,
by voting for what his fellow-ministers
had convinced him was
necessary. They wanted the manliness
to do what they had previously
convinced him, according to their
ideas, would be but an act of justice.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_738">738</span></p>

<p>But the fact was, her Majesty's
Canadian Executive Council had calculated
too highly upon their own
strength, or, having provoked the
storm, they shrunk back in terror at
its violence and its consequences.
They were, therefore, obliged to resort
to the skin of the fox, to make up
what they found they wanted of that
of the lion. And the substitution
was managed after the following
manner:</p>

<p>The amendment alluded to by Mr
Merritt, or the operative part of it,
was in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That the losses, so far only as they have
arisen from the total, or <i>partially unjust,
unnecessary</i>, or wanton destruction of the
dwellings, buildings, property, and effects
of the said inhabitants [of Lower Canada],
and by the seizure, taking, or carrying
away of their property and effects, should
be satisfied; provided that none of the
persons who have been convicted of high
treason, alleged to have been committed
in that part of this province formerly
called Lower Canada, since the first day
of November 1847, or who, having been
charged with high treason, or other
offences of a treasonable nature, and having
been committed to the custody of the
sheriff in the gaol of Montreal, submitted
themselves to the will and pleasure of her
Majesty, and were thereupon transported
to her Majesty's island of Bermuda, shall
be entitled to any indemnity for losses
sustained during or after the said rebellion,
or in consequence thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p>This amendment is worded carefully
enough, and, like Mr Lafontaine's
resolution, is apparently just and harmless
in its abstract signification; but it
proves, like the former, a vastly different
matter when its intentions come
to be discovered by its practical application.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the reader
should understand that there were a
great number of the French rebels,
particularly the leading characters,
who fled the country immediately after
the first few contests were over&mdash;and
some of them were brave enough not
even to wait so long&mdash;who came back
under the amnesty, and consequently
neither submitted themselves to the
custody of the sheriff of Montreal,
nor were prosecuted in any way: these
are, therefore, no matter how high, or
how notorious their treason, exempted
from disability, under this amendment,
to claim rebellion losses. Among
these was a Doctor Wolfred Nelson,
who was commander-in-chief of the
rebels at the battles of St Denis and
St Charles; who fought with them as
well as he could; who published the
declaration of independence for the
Canadas; who, after he had made his
escape to the States, hovered round
the borders as the leader of the piratical
gangs that devastated the country;
and whom General Wood was finally
despatched by the United States government
to put down. This individual
is now a member of the Canadian parliament
for a French county, and is an
<i>admitted</i> claimant, under Mr Boulton's
amendment, for twenty-three thousand
pounds, <i>for his rebellion losses</i>. His
own words in the debate upon the
question are these:&mdash;"As to the
claims made for my property, I had
sent in a detailed account of the losses
which had occurred, and which
amounted to £23,000, of which £11,000
did not belong to me, but to my creditors.
I mentioned their names, and
as far as my memory would serve,
that was the amount." Now, setting
aside the doctrine, subversive even of
all traitors' honour, and of all security
under any government, that men may
first half destroy a country by rebellion,
and afterwards make up the
other half of its destruction by claiming
indemnity for incidental losses;
setting aside this question, and
viewing the matter in the abstract
light, that all claims for injuries should
be paid, we should like to know who
is to pay the creditors of the poor
widows of the soldiers and the loyalists
whose blood stained the snows of
Canada in suppressing Dr Wolfred
Nelson's rebellion? Who is to feed
their children, who are at this moment&mdash;we
can vouch for the fact
in at least one instance&mdash;shoeless
and houseless, wandering upon the
world? Yet Dr Nelson's creditors,
on account of Dr Nelson's crime,
must be paid. Who is to pay the
creditors of the merchants, of the
millers, of the lumberers, who were
ruined by the general devastation that
Dr Nelson's rebellion brought upon
Lower Canada? Still Dr Nelson's
creditors must be paid, although he
spent the very money in bringing about
other people's ruin. Who is to indemnify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">739</span>
the people of England for two
millions sterling spent in putting down
Dr Nelson's rebellion? Yet Dr Nelson's
property must be made good,
and Dr Nelson's creditors must be
paid, because England was under the
necessity of putting down Dr Nelson's
insurrection. And will&mdash;can England
look on with indifference while Upper
Canada&mdash;whose loyalists, when she
was without a soldier to hoist her
flag, did it for her&mdash;whose people freely
and gladly sacrificed their lives, as
well in the hardships as in the struggle
with the traitor and the assassin,
and whose trade and property were
wellnigh ruined by this Dr Wolfred
Nelson's rebellion&mdash;is now called
upon to make good to him money
he spent in carrying it on, and property
that shared but the common
ruin he brought upon the whole country?
Yet Dr Nelson's payment is now
decided upon by the parliament of
Canada; and as the climax of such
unheard-of legislation, he voted for
it himself.</p>

<p>When such a coach-and-four as this
can walk through Mr Boulton's
amendment, it is needless to spend
time upon smaller fry. The loyalists
of Canada have now, or will have, if
the governor, or the British government
assents to the measure, to pay
for the very torch that was employed
to set fire to their homes; for the
guns that were used to shoot them
down by the wayside; for the shoes
that an enemy who challenged them
to fight, wore out in running away;
for the time that men who, assassin-like,
established hunters' lodges in
the States, for the purpose of cutting
down the defenceless, and burning up
the unprotected, were engaged in the
conception and execution of their diabolical
designs. These may be strong
statements, but they are facts. We
need go no farther than Dr Nelson's
case, who claims indemnity for the
very money he spent in buying powder
and balls to destroy her Majesty's
subjects, and who claims £12,000 for
injury to his property, while he himself
was at the head of gangs of desperadoes
laying waste the whole
southern frontier of the province to
sustain them.</p>

<p>But, to convey an idea to the English
reader of the full extent to which
payment may be, and is contemplated
to be, made to parties engaged in the
rebellion, under this amendment, we
need but quote the questions that
were put to Mr Lafontaine, before the
final vote was taken on the question,
and the manner in which he treated
them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In committee last night, Colonel
Prince stated that a great deal of uncertainty
existed as to the class of persons
whom it was intended by the ministry to
pay, under the measure introduced by
them, and he begged Mr Attorney General
Lafontaine to settle the matter explicitly
by replying to certain questions
which he would put to him. Colonel
Prince promised, on his part, to regard
the replies as final, and after receiving
them, he would allude no further to the
rebellion claims.</p>

<p>He then put the following questions
in a deliberate, solemn manner, pausing
between each for an answer.</p>

<p>'Do you propose to exclude, in your
instructions to the commissioners to be
appointed under this act, all who aided
and abetted in the rebellion of 1837-1838?'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No Reply.</span></p>

<p>'Do you propose to exclude those,
who, by their admissions and confessions,
admitted their participation in the rebellion?'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No Reply.</span></p>

<p>'Do you mean to exclude those whose
admission of guilt is at this very moment
in the possession of the government, or of
the courts of law, unless these admissions
have been destroyed with the connivance
of honourable gentlemen opposite?'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No Reply.</span></p>

<p>'Do you mean to exclude any of those
800 men who were imprisoned in the jail
of Montreal, for their participation in the
rebellion, and who were subsequently
discharged from custody through the
clemency of the government, and whose
claims I understand to exceed some
£70,000?'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No Reply.</span></p>

<p>'Do you not mean to pay every one,
let his participation in the rebellion have
been what it may, except the very few
who were convicted by the courts-martial,
and some six or seven who admitted their
guilt and were sent to Bermuda?'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No Reply.</span>"</p>

<p class="author">
<i>Montreal Gazette.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But what course did the enlightened
reformers of Upper Canada take in
this business&mdash;did that party which
Lord Durham expressly stated was
made up, for the most part, of men of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">740</span>
strong British feelings, and by whose
aid the French domination was to be
crushed? Out of the strongest majority&mdash;out
of the most united and
effective representation of the whole
party that has ever been had since
Sir Francis Head assumed the government
of the province, one only voted
against the French; seventeen voted
with them, and five found it convenient
to be absent.</p>

<p>But, bad as this measure is, and
plainly as it shows that England's
friends have been rendered politically
powerless in the provinces, it is even
better than the representation scheme,
which these two parties have still
more unitedly, and, if anything, more
determinedly endeavoured to push
through parliament. The following
extracts from the leading journals of
both provinces, will convey an idea
of the intention of this measure, and
what it is likely to lead to:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The rebellion claims which have
roused, in every English breast, a feeling
of strong antipathy against the French
Canadian race, is but an affair of skirmishing,
preparatory to the great battle for
perpetual domination in Canada by the
French Canadian race over those whom
Mr Lafontaine has styled their 'natural
enemies.' It is the Representation scheme
that is to raise over us, for ever, our
'French Masters.' As an affair of money,
that of the Rebellion Losses is an injury
and insult to every man who obeyed the
order of the government in its time of
need. It has planted deeply the seeds of
a never-dying irritation, but it involves not
our national existence. The Representation
scheme is a triple iniquity, and
will cement, if the madness of party be
strong enough to carry it, all the little
differences of parties among Englishmen,
into one settled, determined hatred of the
French race. It is a triple iniquity&mdash;an
injury, an insult, and slavery to our children."&mdash;<i>Montreal
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"By the Ministerial scheme, then, it
is proposed to give the British Canadian
population, say 13 members&mdash;as follows:
&mdash;Ottawa 2, Argenteuil 1, Drummond
(doubtful) 1, Sherbrooke 2, Shefford 1,
Huntingdon 1, Megantic 1, Missisquoi 1,
Gaspé 1, Stanstead 1, Sherbrooke Town
1. Thus leaving 62 members for the
Franco-Canadians&mdash;giving the former an
increase on their present number of 3 and
the latter of 30! Can this be called a
just proportion? It cannot."&mdash;<i>Montreal
Herald.</i></p>

<p>"That measure extends over the whole
of the province&mdash;<i>Lower</i> as well as <i>Upper</i>
Canada; and one of its leading features
being, according to the testimony of Mr
Hincks, to insure to the French Canadians
the perpetuation of their ascendency in
the legislature, as a distinct race, we
may look forward in future to the infliction
of the most oppressive measures, upon
the colonists of British origin, which the
masters of the Union may choose to dictate.
These are the fruits of radical
ascendency in the executive and the
legislature, from Upper Canada, and the
prostration of those of British origin in
Lower Canada."&mdash;<i>British Colonist, Toronto.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, however&mdash;fortunately
even for those it was intended to
invest with so great a power, this
measure did not pass. For to give a
naturally unprogressive race legislative
superiority over an inevitably progressive
one, is but to prolong a
contest, or make more desperate an
immediate struggle. The race that
advances will not perpetually strive
with a rope round its neck, or a chain
round its leg. If it cannot loose itself,
it will turn round and fight its
holders. The French might have
bound the English, but they would
have had to fight them. A miss,
however, is as good as a mile. It
required a vote of two-thirds of the
whole house to make such a change
in the representation. Fifty-six
voters would have done it; they had
but fifty-five; so that this part of the
storm at all events has passed over.</p>

<p>But how did the enlightened reformers
of Upper Canada act, upon a
measure avowedly and undisguisedly
intended to perpetuate French domination?
<i>Every man of them voted
for it.</i> What a melancholy comment
this is upon the following&mdash;the
closing reflection of Lord Durham,
upon the government of
Canada. What a comment it is upon
the attempt to change a people by a
measure; to purge out of Frenchmen
errors as strong as their nature&mdash;out
of democrats feelings as large as their
souls, by a single pill of abstract right
in the shape of responsible government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the state of mind in which I have
described the French Canadian population,
as not only now being, but as likely
for a long while to remain, the trusting
them with an entire control over this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_741">741</span>
province would be, in fact, only facilitating
a rebellion. Lower Canada must be
governed now, as it must be hereafter, by
an English population; and thus the
policy which the necessities of the moment
force on us, is in accordance with
that suggested by a comprehensive view
of the future and permanent improvement
of the province."&mdash;<i>Report Can. E.</i>, p. 127.</p></blockquote>

<p>But it is not alone that British
prosperity is now crushed by the
domination of a retrogressive race,
but it is that a British people are
obliged to feel the galling and unnatural
fact, that the power of the
government of England is wielded to
keep up institutions in America, to
the destruction of which, in Europe, it
owes its freedom and its greatness. It
is not alone that loyalty is sickened
to the very death in Upper Canada,
at seeing the best gifts of the crown
handed over to political pickpockets&mdash;for
we hold every man, and we can call
upon all America to second us in it,
as no better than a political pickpocket,
who is a democrat in his
heart and soul, and whines out "God
save the Queen," to pillage her Majesty's
treasury&mdash;it is not alone that
loyalty is galled to madness at this,
but it is that loyalty is obliged to see
that, however much it may beat these
men at the hustings, and by virtue
of the constitution, they can still
laugh at all its efforts as long as
they can play the part of French tools.
In all history, in short, there is not a
parallel to the state of things at present
existing in the Canadas. To men
whose very accents, whose very faces
are a living libel upon all loyalty to
England, England has by her legislation
given power to trample under their
feet the only friends she had in the
hour of her need. To men who are contending
for the perpetuation of institutions
which all Europe was obliged
to throw off before it could breathe a
free breath, or extend a free arm,
England has by her legislation given
the power, not only to drive her
children into the slough of despond,
but to mount upon their shoulders there,
and sink them irretrievably. England
has literally in the Canadas
made her loyalists political slaves;
her enemies their political task-masters.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>"Under the opening eyelids of the Morn!" Mefeels, Amici, at this moment,
the charm of that Impersonation. Slowly awaking from sleep&mdash;scarcely
conscious of her whereabouts&mdash;bewildered by the beauty of the revelation,
nor recognising her beloved lochs and mountains&mdash;visionary and nameless
all as if an uncertain prolongation of her Summer's Night's Dream.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I was not going to speak, my dear sir.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And now she is broad awake. She sees the heaven and the earth, nor
thinks, God bless her, that 'tis herself that beautifies them!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Twenty years since I stood on this knoll, honoured sir, by your side&mdash;twenty
years to a day&mdash;and now the same perfect peace possesses me&mdash;mysterious
return&mdash;as if all the intervening time slid away&mdash;and this were not a
renewed but a continuous happiness.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And let it slide away into the still recesses of Memory&mdash;the Present has its
privileges&mdash;and they may be blamelessly, wisely, virtuously enjoyed&mdash;and
without irreverence to the sanctity of the Past. Let it slide away&mdash;but not into
oblivion&mdash;no danger, no fear of oblivion&mdash;even joys will return on their wings
of gossamer;&mdash;sorrows may be buried, but they are immortal.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I see not the slightest change on this Grove of Sycamores. Twenty years
tell not on boles that have for centuries been in their prime. Yes&mdash;that one
a little way down&mdash;and that one still farther off&mdash;<i>have</i> grown&mdash;and those
striplings, then but saplings, may now be called Trees.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I never heard such a noise.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>A cigar in your mouth at four o'clock in the morning! Well&mdash;well.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>There, my dear sir, keep me in countenance with a Manilla.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The Herb! You have high authority&mdash;Spenser's&mdash;for "noise."</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I said Noise&mdash;because it is Noise. Why, the hum of bees overhead is absolutely
like soft sustained thunder&mdash;and yet no bees visible in the umbrage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_743">743</span>
The sound is like that of one single bee, and he must be a giant. Ay&mdash;there
I see a few working like mad&mdash;and I guess there must be myriads. The Grove
must be full of bees' nests.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Not one. Hundreds of smokes are stealing up from hidden or apparent
cottages&mdash;for the region is not unpopulous, and not a garden without its hives&mdash;and
early risers though we be, the <i>matutinæ apes</i> are still before us, and so
are the birds.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>They, too, are making a noise. Who says a shilfa cannot sing? Of the
fifty now "pouring his throat," as the poet well says, I defy you to tell which
sings best. That splendid fellow on the birch-tree top&mdash;or yonder gorgeous
tyke on the yellow oak&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>"In shadiest covert hid" the leader of the chorus that thrills the many-nested
underwood with connubial bliss.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Not till this moment heard I the waterfall.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>You did, though, all along&mdash;a felt accompaniment.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I know few dens more beautiful than Cladich-Cleugh!</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Pardon me, sir, if I do not attempt that name.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>How mellifluous!&mdash;Cladich-Cleugh!</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Great is the power of gutturals.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>It is not inaccessible. But you must skirt it till you reach the meadow
where the cattle are beginning to browse. And then threading your way
through a coppice, where you are almost sure to see a roe, you come down
upon a series of little pools, in such weather as this so clear that you can
count the trouts; and then the verdurous walls begin to rise on either side
and right before you; and you begin to feel that the beauty is becoming magnificence,
for the pools are now black, and the stems are old, and the cliffs intercept
the sky, and there are caves, and that waterfall has dominion in the
gloom, and there is sublimity in the sounding solitude.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Cladick-Cloock.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>A miserable failure.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Cladig-Cloog.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Worser and worser.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Any footpath, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;for the roe and the goat.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And the Man of the Crutch.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Good. But I speak of days when the Crutch was in its tree-bole&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>As the Apollo was in its marble block.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Not so good. But, believe me, gentlemen, I have done it with the Crutch.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Ay, sir, and could do it again.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">744</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>No. But you two are yet boys&mdash;on the sunny side of fifty&mdash;and I leave
you, Seward, to act the guide to Buller up Cladich-Cleugh.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Pray, Mr North, what may be the name of that sheet of water?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>In Scotland we call it <span class="smcap">Loch-Owe</span>.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I am so happy&mdash;sir&mdash;that I talk nonsense.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Much nonsense may you talk.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>'Twas a foolish question&mdash;but you know, sir, that by some strange fatality
or another I have been three times called away from Scotland without having
seen <i>Lock-Owe</i>.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Make good use of your eyes now, sirrah, and you will remember it all the
days of your life. That is Cruachan&mdash;no usurper he&mdash;by divine right a king.
The sun is up, and there is motion in the clouds. Saw you ever such shadows?
How majestically they stalk! And now how beautifully they glide!
And now see you that broad black forest, half-way up the mountain?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>You are sure you do.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>You are mistaken. It is no broad black forest&mdash;it is mere gloom&mdash;shadow
that in a minute will pass away, though now seeming steadfast as the
woods.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I could swear it is a forest.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Swear not at all. Shut your eyes. Open them. Where now your wood?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Most extraordinary ocular deception.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Quite common. Yet no poet has described it. See again. The same forest
a mile off. No need of trees&mdash;sun and cloud make our visionary mountains
sylvan: and the grandest visions are ever those that are transitory&mdash;ask
your soul.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Your Manilla is out, my dear sir. There is the case.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Caught like a cricketer. You must ascend Cruachan. "This morning gives
us promise of a glorious day;" you cannot do better than take time by the forelock,
and be off now. Say the word&mdash;and I will myself row you over the
Loch. No need of a guide: inclining to the left for an hour or two after you
have cleared yonder real timber and sap wood&mdash;and then for an hour or two,
to the right&mdash;and then for another hour or two straight forwards&mdash;and then
you will see the highest of the three peaks within an hour or two's walk of
you&mdash;and thus, by mid-day, find yourself seated on the summit.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Seated on the summit!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Not too long, for the air is often very sharp at that altitude&mdash;and so rare,
that I have heard tell of people fainting.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I am occasionally troubled with a palpitation of the heart&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">745</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Pooh, nonsense. Only the stomach.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And occasionally with a determination of blood to the head&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Pooh, nonsense. Only the stomach. Take a calker every two hours on your
way up&mdash;and I warrant both heart and head&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Not to-day. It looks cloudy.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Why, I don't much care though I should accompany you&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I knew you would offer to do so, and I feel the delicacy of putting a decided
negative on the proposal. Let us defer it till to-morrow. For my sake, my
dear sir, if not for your own, do not think of it; it will be no disappointment
to me to remain with you here&mdash;and I shudder at the thought of your fainting
on the summit. Be advised, my dear sir, be advised&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Well then, be it so&mdash;I am not obstinate; but such another day for the
ascent there may not be during the summer. On just such a day I made the
ascent some half-century ago. I took it from Tyanuilt&mdash;having walked
that morning from Dalmally, some dozen miles, for a breathing on level
ground, before facing the steepish shoulder that roughens into Loch Etive.
The fox-hunter from Gleno gave me his company with his hounds and terriers
nearly half-way up, and after killing some cubs we parted&mdash;not without
a tinful of the creature at the Fairies' Well&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>A tinful of the creature at the Fairies' Well!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Yea&mdash;a tinful of the creature at the Fairies' Well. Now I am a total-abstinent&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>A total-abstinent!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>By heavens! he echoes me. Pleasant, but mournful to the soul is the
memory of joys that are past! A tinful of the unchristened creature to
the health of the Silent People. Oh! Buller, there are no Silent People now.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>In your company, sir, I am always willing to be a listener.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Well, on I flew as on wings.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>What! Up Cruackan?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>On feet, then, if you will; but the feet of a deer.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>On all-fours?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;sometimes on all-fours. On all-fours, like a frog in his prime, clearing
tiny obstructions with a spang. On all-fours, like an ourang-outang,
who, in difficult places, brings his arms into play. On all-fours, like the&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I cry you mercy.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Without palpitation of the heart; without determination of blood to the
head; without panting; without dizziness; with merely a slight acceleration
of the breath, and now and then something like a gasp after a run to a knowe
which we foresaw as a momentary resting-place&mdash;we felt that we were conquering
Cruachan!  Lovely level places, like platforms&mdash;level as if water had
formed them, flowing up just so far continually, and then ebbing back to some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_746">746</span>
unimaginable sea&mdash;awaited our arrival, that on them we might lie down, and
from beds of state survey our empire, for our empire it was felt to be, far
away into the lowlands, with many a hill between&mdash;many a hill, that, in its
own neighbourhood, is believed to be a mountain&mdash;just as many a man of
moderate mental dimensions is believed by those who live beneath his shade
to be of the first order of magnitude, and with funeral honours is interred.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Well for him that he is a hill at all&mdash;eminent on a flat, or among humbler
undulations. All is comparative.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Just so. From a site on a mountain's side&mdash;far from the summit&mdash;the
ascender hath sometimes a sublimer&mdash;often a lovelier vision&mdash;than from its
most commanding peak. Yet still he has the feeling of ascension&mdash;stifle
that, and the discontent of insufficiency dwarfs and darkens all that lies
below.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Words to the wise.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>We fear to ascend higher lest we should lose what we comprehend: yet we
will ascend higher, though we know the clouds are gathering, and we are
already enveloped in mist. But there were no clouds&mdash;no mist on that day&mdash;and
the secret top of Cruachan was clear as a good man's conscience, and
the whole world below like the promised land.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Let us go&mdash;let us go&mdash;let us go.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>All knowledge, my dear boy, may be likened to stupendous ranges of
mountains&mdash;clear and clouded, smooth and precipitous; and you or I in youth
assail them in joy and pride of soul, not blind but blindfolded often, and
ignorant of their inclination; so that we often are met by a beetling cliff
with its cataract, and must keep ascending and descending ignorant of our
whereabouts, and summit-seeking in vain. Yet all the while are we glorified.
In maturer mind, when experience is like an instinct, we ascertain levels
without a theodolite, and know assuredly where dwell the peaks. We know
how to ascend&mdash;sideways or right on; we know which are midway heights;
we can walk in mist and cloud as surely as in light, and we learn to know
the Inaccessible.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I fear you will fatigue yourself&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Or another image. You sail down a stream, my good Buller, which widens
as it flows, and will lead through inland seas&mdash;or lochs&mdash;down to the mighty
ocean: what that is I need not say: you sail down it, sometimes with hoisted
sail&mdash;sometimes with oars&mdash;on a quest or mission all undefined; but often
anchoring where no need is, and leaping ashore, and engaging in pursuits
or pastimes forbidden or vain&mdash;<i>with the natives</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>The natives!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Nay, adopting their dress&mdash;though dress it be none at all&mdash;and becoming
one of themselves&mdash;naturalised; forgetting your mission clean out of mind!
Fishing and hunting with the natives&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Whom?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The natives&mdash;when you ought to have been pursuing your voyage on&mdash;on&mdash;on.
Such are youth's pastimes all. But you had not deserted&mdash;not you:
and you return of your own accord to the ship.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>What ship?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_747">747</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The ship of life&mdash;leaving some to lament you, who knew you only as a
jolly mariner, who was bound afar! They believed that you had drawn up
your pinnace for ever on that shore, in that lovely little haven, among reeds
and palms&mdash;unknowing that you would relaunch her some day soon, and,
bounding in her over the billows, rejoin your ship, waiting for you in the
offing, and revisit the simple natives no more!</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Methinks I understand now your mysterious meaning.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>You do. But where was I?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Ascending Cruackan, and near the summit.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>On the summit. Not a whit tired&mdash;not a bit fatigued; strong as ten&mdash;active
as twenty ownselves on the flat&mdash;divinely drunk on draughts of ether&mdash;happier
a thousand times, greater and more glorious, than Jupiter, with all
his gods, enthroned on Olympus.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Moderately speaking.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>In imagination I hear him barking now as he barked then&mdash;a sharp, short,
savage, angry and hungry bark&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>What? A dog? A Fox?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>No&mdash;no&mdash;no. An Eagle&mdash;the Golden Eagle from Ben-Slarive, known&mdash;no
mistaking him&mdash;to generations of Shepherds for a hundred years.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Do you see him?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Now I do. I see his eyes&mdash;for he came&mdash;he comes sughing close by me&mdash;and
there he shoots up in terror a thousand feet into the sky.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I did not know the Bird was so timid&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>He is not timid&mdash;he is bold; but an Eagle does not like to come all at once
within ten yards of an unexpected man&mdash;any more than you would like suddenly
to face a ghost.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>What brought him there?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Wings nine feet wide.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Has he no sense of smell?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>What do you mean, sir?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>No offence.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>He has. But we have not always all our senses about us, Buller, nor our
wits either&mdash;he had been somewhat scared, a league up Glen Etive, by the
Huntsman of Gleno&mdash;the scent of powder was in his nostrils; but fury follows
fear, and in a minute I heard his bark again&mdash;as now I hear it&mdash;on
the highway to Benlura.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>He must have had enormous talons.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>My hand is none of the smallest&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>God bless you, my dear sir,&mdash;give me a grasp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_748">748</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>There.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Oh! thumbikins!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And one of his son's talons&mdash;whom I shot&mdash;was twice the length of mine;
his yellow knobby loof at least as broad&mdash;and his leg like my wrist. He killed
a man. Knocked him down a precipice, like a cannon-ball. He had the
credit of it all over the country&mdash;but I believe his wife did the business, for
she was half-again as big as himself; and no devil like a she-devil fighting for
her imp.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Did you ever rob an Eyrie, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Did you over rob a Lion's den? No, no, Buller. I never&mdash;except on duty&mdash;placed
my life in danger. I have been in many dangerous-looking places
among the Mountains, but a cautious activity ruled all my movements&mdash;I
scanned my cliff before I scaled him&mdash;and as for jumping chasms&mdash;though I
had a spring in me&mdash;I looked imaginatively down the abyss, and then sensibly
turned its flank where it leaned on the greensward, and the liberated streamlet
might be forded, without swimming, by the silly sheep.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And are all those stories lies?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>All. I have sometimes swam a loch or a river in my clothes&mdash;but never
except when they lay in my way, or when I was on an angling excursion&mdash;and
what danger could there possibly be in doing that?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>You might have taken the Cramp, Sir.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And the Cramp might have taken me&mdash;but neither of us ever did&mdash;and a
man, with a short neck or a long one, might as well shun the streets in perpetual
fear of apoplexy, as a good swimmer evade water in dread of being
drowned.  As for swimming in my clothes&mdash;had I left them on the hither,
how should I have looked on the thither side?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>No man, in such circumstances, could, with any satisfaction to himself,
have pursued his journey, even through the most lonesome places.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Describe the view from the summit.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I have no descriptive power&mdash;but, even though I had, I know better than
that. Why, between Cruachan and Buchail-Etive lie hundreds on hundreds of
mountains of the first, second, and third order&mdash;and, for a while at first, your
eyes are so bewildered that you cannot see any one in particular; yet, in your
astonishment, have a strange vision of them all&mdash;and might think they were
interchanging places, shouldering one another off into altering shapes in the
uncertain region, did not the awful stillness assure you that there they had
all stood in their places since the Creation, and would stand till the day of
doom.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>You have no descriptive power!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>All at once dominion is given you over the Whole. You gradually see
Order in what seemed a Chaos&mdash;you understand the character of the Region&mdash;its
Formation&mdash;for you are a Geologist, else you have no business&mdash;no right
there; and you know where the valleys are singing for joy, though you hear
them not&mdash;where there is provision for the cattle on a hundred hills&mdash;where
are the cottages of Christian men on the green braes sheltered by the mountains&mdash;and
where may stand, beneath the granite rocks out of which it was
built, the not unfrequent House of God.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_749">749</span></p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>To-morrow we shall attend Divine Service&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>At Dalmally.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I long ago learned to like the ritual of the Kirk. I should like to believe
in a high-minded purified Calvinist, who could embrace, in his brotherly
heart, a high-minded purified English Bishop, with all his Episcopacy.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And why should he not, if he can recognise the Divine Spirit flowing
through the two sets of sensible demonstrations? He can; unless the constitution
of the Anglican Christian Religion wars, either by its dogmas or by
its ecclesiastical ordinances, against his essential intelligence of Christianity.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And who shall say it does?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Many say it&mdash;not I.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And you are wise and good.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Many thousands&mdash;and hundreds of thousands, wiser and better. I can
easily suppose a Mind&mdash;strong in thought, warm in feeling, of an imagination
susceptible and creative&mdash;by magnanimity, study, and experience of the
world, disengaged from all sectarian tenets&mdash;yet holding the absolute conviction
of religion&mdash;and contemplating, with reverence and tenderness, many
different ways of expression which this inmost spiritual disposition has produced
or put on&mdash;having a firmest holding on to Christianity as pure, holy,
august, divine, true, beyond all other modes of religion upon the Earth&mdash;partly
from intuition of its essential fitness to our nature&mdash;partly from intense
gratitude&mdash;partly, perhaps, from the original entwining of it with his own
faculties, thoughts, feelings, history, being.  Well, he looks with affectionate
admiration upon the Scottish, with affectionate admiration on the English
Church&mdash;old affection agreeing with new affection&mdash;and I can imagine in <i>him</i>
as much generosity required to love his own Church&mdash;the Presbyterian&mdash;as
yours the Episcopalian&mdash;and that, Latitudinarian as he may be called, he
loves them both. For myself, you know how I love England&mdash;all that belongs
to her&mdash;all that makes her what she is&mdash;scarcely more&mdash;surely not less&mdash;Scotland.
The ground of the Scottish Form is the overbearing consciousness, that
religion is immediately between man and his Maker. All hallowing of things
outward is to that consciousness a placing of such earthly things as interpositions
and separating intermediates in that interval unavoidable between
the Finite and the Infinite, but which should remain blank and clear for the
immediate communications of the Worshipper and the Worshipped.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I believe, sir, you are a Presbyterian?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>He that worships in spirit and in truth cannot endure&mdash;cannot imagine,
that anything but his own sin shall stand betwixt him and God.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p><i>That</i>, until it be in some way or another extinguished, shall and must.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>True as Holy Writ. But intervening saints, images, and elaborate rituals&mdash;the
contrivance of human wit&mdash;all these the fire of the Spirit has consumed,
and consumes.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>The fire of the Presbyterian spirit?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Add history. War and persecution have afforded an element of human
hate for strengthening the sternness&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_750">750</span></p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Of Presbyterian Scotland.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Drop that word&mdash;for I more than doubt if you understand it.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I beg pardon, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The Scottish service, Mr Buller, comprehends Prayer, Praise, Doctrine&mdash;all
three necessary verbal acts amongst Christians met, but each in utmost simplicity.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Episcopalian as I am, that simplicity I have felt to be most affecting.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The Praise, which unites the voices of the congregation, must be written.
The Prayer, which is the burning towards God of the soul of the Shepherd
upon the behalf of the Flock, and upon his own, must be unwritten&mdash;unpremeditated&mdash;else
it is not Prayer. Can the heart ever want fitting words? The
Teaching must be to the utmost, forethought, at some time or at another, as to
the Matter. The Teacher must have secured his intelligence of the Matter ere
he opens his mouth. But the Form, which is of expediency only, he may very
loosely have considered. That is the Theory.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Often liable in practice, I should fear, to sad abuse.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>May be so. But it presumes that capable men, full of zeal, and sincerity,
and love&mdash;fervent servants and careful shepherds&mdash;have been chosen, under
higher guidance. It supposes the holy fire of the new-born Reformation&mdash;of
the newly-regenerated Church&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Kirk.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Of the newly-regenerated Church, to continue undamped, inextinguishable.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And is it so?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The Fact answers to the Theory more or less. The original Thought&mdash;simplicity
of worship&mdash;is to the utmost expressed, when the chased Covenanters
are met on the greensward, between the hillside and the brawling brook,
under the coloured or uncoloured sky. Understand that, when their descendants
meet within walls and beneath roofs, they <i>would</i> worship after the manner
of their hunted ancestors.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I wish I were better read than I am, in the history of Scotland, civil and
ecclesiastical.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I wish you were. I say, then, my excellent friend, that the Ritual and
whole Ordering of the Scottish Church is moulded upon, or issues out of, the
human spirit kindling in conscious communication of the Divine Spirit. The
power of the Infinite&mdash;that is, the Sense of Infinitude, of Eternity&mdash;reigns
there; and the Sense in the inmost soul of the sustaining contact with Omnipotence,
and self-consciousness intense, and elation of Divine favour personally
vouchsafed, and joy of anticipated everlasting bliss, and triumph over
Satan, death, and hell, and immeasurable desire to win souls to the King of
the Worlds.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>In England we are, I am ashamed to say it, ill informed on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>In Scotland we are, I am ashamed to say it, ill informed on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>But go on, sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_751">751</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>What place is there for Forms of any kind in the presence of these immense
overpowering Realities? For Forms, Buller, are of the Imagination; the Faculty
that inhales and lives by the Unreal. But some concession to the humanity
of our nature intrudes. Imagination may be subordinated, subjugated, but
will not, may not, forego all its rights. Therefore, Forms and hallowing associations
enter.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Into all Worship.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Form, too, is, in part, Necessary Order.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Perhaps, sir, you may be not unwilling to say a few words of our Ritual.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I tremble to speak of your Ritual; for it appears to me as bearing on its
front an excellence which might be found incompatible with religious truth
and sincerity.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I confess that I hardly understand you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The Liturgy looks to be that which the old Churches are, the Work of a
Fine Art.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>You do not urge that as an objection to it, I trust, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>A Poetical sensibility, a wakeful, just, delicate, simple Taste, seems to
have ruled over the composition of each Prayer, and the ordering of the whole
Service.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>You do not urge that as an objection to it, I trust, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I am not urging objections, sir. I seldom&mdash;never, indeed&mdash;urge objections
to anything. I desire only to place all things in their true light.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Don't frown, sir&mdash;smile. Enough.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The whole composition of the Service is copious and various. Human Supplication,
the lifting up of the hands of the creature knowing his own weakness,
dependence, lapses, and liability to slip&mdash;man's own part, dictated by
his own experience of himself, is the basis. Readings from the Old and New
Volume of the Written Word are ingrafted, as if God audibly spoke in his
own House; the Authoritative added to the Supplicatory.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Finely true. We Church of England men love you, Mr North&mdash;we do
indeed.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The hymns of the sweet Singer of Israel, in literal translation, adopted as a
holier inspired language of the heart.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>These, sir, are surely three powerful elements of a Ritual Service.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Throughout, the People divide, the service with the Minister. They have in
it their own personal function.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Then the Homily, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay, the Homily, which, one might say, interprets between Sunday and the
Week&mdash;fixes the holiness of the Day in precepts, doctrines, reflections, which
may be carried home to guide and nourish.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Altogether, sir, it seems a meet work of worshippers met in their Christian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">752</span>
Land, upon the day of rest and aspiration. The Scottish worship might seem
to remember the flame and the sword. The persecuted Iconoclasts of two
centuries ago, live in their descendants.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>But the Ritual of England breathes a divine calm. You think of the People
walking through ripening fields on a mild day to their Church door. It is the
work of a nation sitting in peace, possessing their land. It is the work of a
wealthy nation, that, by dedicating a part of its wealth, consecrates the remainder&mdash;that
acknowledges the Fountain from which all flows. The prayers
are devout, humble, fervent. They are not impassioned. A wonderful temperance
and sobriety of discretion; that which, in worldly things, would be
called good sense, prevails in them; but you must name it better in things
spiritual. The framers evidently bore in mind the continual consciousness of
writing for <span class="smcap">ALL</span>. That is the guiding, tempering, calming spirit that keeps in
the Whole one tone&mdash;that, and the hallowing, chastening awe which subdues
vehemence, even in the asking for the Infinite, by those who have nothing but
that which they earnestly ask, and who know that unless they ask infinitely,
they ask nothing. In every word, the whole Congregation, the whole Nation
prays&mdash;not the Individual Minister; the officiating Divine Functionary, not the
Man. Nor must it be forgotten that the received Version and the Book of
Common Prayer&mdash;observe the word <span class="smcap">Common</span>, expressing exactly what I
affirm&mdash;are beautiful by the words&mdash;that there is no other such English&mdash;simple,
touching, apt, venerable&mdash;hued as the thoughts are&mdash;musical&mdash;the most
English English that is known&mdash;of a Hebraic strength and antiquity, yet lucid
and gracious as if of and for to-day.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I trust that many Presbyterians sympathise with you in these sentiments.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Not many&mdash;few. Nor do I say I wish they were more.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Are you serious, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I am. But cannot explain myself now. What are the Three Pillars of
the Love of any Church? Innate Religion&mdash;Humanity&mdash;Imagination.
The Scottish worship better satisfies the first Principle&mdash;that of England
the last; the Roman Catholic still more the last&mdash;and are not your
Cathedrals Roman Catholic? I think that the Scottish and English, better
than the Roman Catholic, satisfy the Middle Principle&mdash;Humanity, being
truer to the highest requisitions of our Nature, and nourish our faculties better,
both of Will and Understanding, into their strength and beauty. Yet what
divine-minded Roman Catholics there have been&mdash;and are&mdash;and will be!</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Pause for a moment, sir,&mdash;here comes Seward.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Seward! Is he not with us? Surely he was, all hour or two ago&mdash;but
I never missed him&mdash;your conversation has been so interesting and instructive.
Seward! why you are all the world like a drowned rat?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Rat I am none&mdash;but a stanch Conservative. Would I had had a Protectionist
with me to keep me right on the Navigation Laws.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>What do you mean? What's the matter?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Why, your description of the Pools in Cladich-Cleugh inspired me with a
passion for one of the Naïads.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And you have had a ducking!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I have indeed. Plashed souse, head over heels, into one of the prettiest
pools, from a slippery ledge some dozen feet above the sleeping beauty&mdash;were
you both deaf that you did not hear me bawl?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">753</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I have a faint recollection of hearing something bray, but I suppose I
thought it came from the Gipsies' Camp.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Are you wet?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Come&mdash;come&mdash;Buller.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Why so dry?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Sair drooket.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Where's your Tile?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I hate slang.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Why, you have lost a shoe&mdash;and much delightful conversation.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I must say, Seward, that I was hurt by your withdrawing yourself from
our Colloquy.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Sir, you were beginning to get so prosy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I insist, Seward, on your making an apology on your knees to our Father
for your shocking impiety&mdash;I shudder to repeat the word&mdash;which you must
swallow&mdash;<span class="smcap">P&mdash;R&mdash;O&mdash;S&mdash;Y</span>!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>On my knees! Look at them.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>My dear, dearer, dearest Mr Seward&mdash;you are bleeding&mdash;I fear a fracture.
Let me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I am not bleeding&mdash;only a knap on the knee-pan, sir.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Not bleeding! Why you must be drenched in blood, your face is so white.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>A <i>non sequitur</i>, Buller. But from a knap on the knee-pan I have known a
man a lamiter for life.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I lament the loss of my Sketch-Book.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>It is a judgment on you for that Caricature.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>What caricature?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Since you will force me to tell it, a caricature of&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Yourself</span>, sir. I saw
him working away at it with a most wicked leer on his face, while you supposed
he was taking notes. He held it up to me for a moment&mdash;clapped the boards
together with the grin of a fiend&mdash;and then off to Cladick-Cloock&mdash;where he
met with Nemesis.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Is that a true bill, Mr Seward?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>On my honour as a gentleman, and my skill as an artist, it is not. It is a
most malignant misrepresentation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>It was indeed.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>It was no caricature. I promised to Mrs Seward to send her a sketch of
the illustrious Mr North; and finding you in one of the happiest of your many-sided
attitudes&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">754</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>The act is to be judged by the intention. You are acquitted of the charge.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>To make a caricature of <span class="smcap">You</span>, sir, under any circumstances, and for any
purpose, would be sufficiently shocking; but <span class="smcap">HERE AND NOW</span>, and that he
might send it to his <span class="smcap">Wife</span>&mdash;so transcends all previous perpetration of <i>crimen
læsæ majestatis</i>, that I am beginning to be incredulous of what these eyes
beheld&mdash;nay, to disbelieve what, if told to any human being, however
depraved, would seem to him impossible, even in the mystery of iniquity,
and an insane libel on our fallen nature.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I did my best. Nor am I, sir, without hope that my Sketch-Book may be
recovered, and then you will judge for yourself, sir, if it be a caricature. A
failure, sir, it assuredly was, for what artist has succeeded with <span class="smcap">YOU</span>?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>To the Inn, and put on dry clothes.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>No. What care I about dry or wet clothes! Here let me lie down and
bask in this patch of intenser sunshine at your feet. Don't stir, sir; the
Crutch is not the least in the way.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>We must be all up and doing&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Hour</span> and the <span class="smcap">Men</span>. The <span class="smcap">Cavalcade</span>.
Hush! Hark! the Bagpipe! The Cavalcade can't be more than a mile off.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Why staring thus like a Goshawk, sir?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I hear nothing. Seward, do you?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Nothing. And what can he mean by Cavalcade? Yet I believe he has
the Second Sight. I have heard it is in the Family.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Hear nothing? Then both of you must be deaf. But I forget&mdash;we Mountaineers
are Fine-Ears&mdash;your sense of hearing has been educated on the
Flat. Not now? "The Campbells are coming,"&mdash;that's the march&mdash;that's
the go&mdash;that's the gathering.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>A Horn&mdash;a Drum, sure enough&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;that incomprehensible mixture
of groans and yells must be the Bagpipe.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>See yonder they come, over the hill-top&mdash;the ninth mile-stone from Inverary!
There's the <span class="smcap">Van</span>, by the Road-Surveyor lent me for the occasion,
drawn by Four Horses. And there's the <span class="smcap">Waggon</span>, once the property of the
lessee of the Swiss Giantess, a noble Unicorn. And there the <span class="smcap">Six Tent-Carts</span>,
Two-steeded; and there the <span class="smcap">Two Boat-Carriages</span>&mdash;horsed I know
not how. But don't ye see the bonny <span class="smcap">Barges</span> aloft in the air? And Men
on horseback&mdash;count them&mdash;there should be Four. You hear the Bagpipe
now&mdash;surely&mdash;"The Campbells are coming." And here is the whole Concern,
gentlemen, close at hand, deploying across the Bridge.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Has he lost his senses at last?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Have we lost ours? A Cavalcade it is, with a vengeance.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>One minute past Seven! True to their time within sixty seconds. This
way, this way. Here is the Spot, the Centre of the Grove. Bagpipe&mdash;Drum
and Horn&mdash;music all&mdash;silence. Silence, I cry, will nobody assist me
in crying silence?</p>

<p>SEWARD AND BULLER.</p>

<p>Silence&mdash;silence&mdash;silence.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Give me the Speaking-Trumpet that I may call Silence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_755">755</span></p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Stentor may put down the Drum, the Horns, the Fifes, and the Serpent, but
the Bagpipe is above him&mdash;the Drone is deaf as the sea&mdash;the Piper moves in
a sphere of his own&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I don't hear a syllable you are saying&mdash;ah! the storm is dead, and now

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>The prevalent expression is still&mdash;the Benign.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>A singular mixture of tenderness and truculence.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Asleep it is absolutely saint-like.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the faces of Chantry's Sleeping Children in Litchfield

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Composure is the word. Composure is mute Harmony.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>It may be so&mdash;but you will not deny that his nose is just a minim too long&mdash;and
his mouth, at this moment, just a minim too open&mdash;and the crow-feet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Or fifty years before. They say that, in youth, the sight of his head of

<p>Why, Mirabeau's was black, and my grandmother told me North's was
yellow&mdash;or rather green, like a star.</p>

<p>Your Grandmother, Buller, was the finest woman of her time.</p>

<p>Sleepers hear. Sometimes a single word from without, reaching the spiritual
region, changes by its touch the whole current of their dreams.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I once told you that, Buller. At present I happen to be awake. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_757">757</span>
surely a man may sit on a swing-chair with his eyes shut, and his mouth open,
without incurring the charge of somnolency. Where have you been?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>You told us, sir, not to disturb you till Two&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>But where have you been?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>We have written our despatches&mdash;read our London Papers&mdash;and had a pull

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>How does she pull?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Like a winner. I have written to the builder&mdash;Taylor of Newcastle&mdash;to

<p>The Iliad, indeed!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I wish you could be persuaded, sir, to give us an Edition of Milton.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>No. I must not take it out of the Doctor's hands. Then, as to Milton's
style. If the Christian Theologian must be held bold who has dared to mix
the Delivered Writings with his own Inventions&mdash;bold, too, was he, the heir of
the mind that was nursed in the Aristotelian Schools, to unite, as he did, on
the other hand, the gait of an understanding accomplished in logic, with the
spontaneous and unstudied step of Poetry. The style of Milton, gentlemen,
has been praised for simplicity; and it is true that the style of the Paradise
Lost has often an austere simplicity; but one sort of it you miss&mdash;the proper
Epic simplicity&mdash;that Homeric simplicity of the <i>Telling</i>.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Perhaps, sir, in such a Poem such simplicity could not be.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Perhaps not. Homer adds thought to thought, and so builds up. Milton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_759">759</span>
involves thought with thought, and so constructs. Relation is with him argumentative
also, and History both Philosophy and Oratory. This was unavoidable.
He brought the mind of the latter age to the Form of Composition
produced by the primitive time. Again, the style is fitted to the general intention
of a Poem essentially didactic and argumentative. Again, the style is
personal to himself. He has learnedly availed himself of all antecedent Art&mdash;minutely
availed himself, yet he is no imitator. The style is like no other&mdash;it
is intensely and completely original. It expresses himself. Lofty, capacious,
acute, luminous, thoroughly disciplined, ratiocinative powers wonderfully
blend their action with an imagination of the most delicate and profound
sensibility to the beautiful, and of a sublimity that no theme can excel.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon, sir, I believe, has defined Poetry, Feigned History&mdash;has he not?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>He has&mdash;and no wonder that he thought much of "Feigned History"&mdash;for
he had a view to Epos and Tragedy&mdash;the Iliad and Odyssey&mdash;the Attic
Theatre&mdash;the Æneid&mdash;Dante&mdash;Ariosto&mdash;Tasso&mdash;the Romances of Chivalry&mdash;moreover,
the whole Immense Greek Fable, whereof part and parcel remain,
but more is perished. Which Fables, you know, existed, and were transmitted
in Prose,&mdash;that is, by Oral Tradition, in the words of the relator,&mdash;long before
they came into Homeric Verse&mdash;or any verse. He saw, Seward, the
Memory of Mankind possessed by two kinds of History, both once alike credited.
True History, which remains True History, and Fabulous History,
now acknowledged as Poetry only. It is no wonder that <i>other</i> Poetry vanished
from importance in his estimation.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I follow you, sir, with some difficulty.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>You may with ease. Fabulous History holds place, side by side, with
True History, as a rival in dignity, credence, and power, and in peopling the
Earth with Persons and Events. For, of a verity, the Personages and Events
created by Poesy hold place in our Mind&mdash;not in our Imagination only, but in
our Understanding, along with Events and Personages historically remembered.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>An imposing Parallelism!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>It is&mdash;but does it hold good? And if it does&mdash;with what limitations?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>With what limitations, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I wish Lord Bacon were here, that I might ask him to explain. Take
Homer and Thucydides&mdash;the Iliad and the History of the Peloponnesian War.
We thus sever, at the widest, the Telling of Calliope from the Telling of Clio,
holding each at the height of honour.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>At the widest?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Yes; for how far from Thucydides is, at once, the Book of the Games!
Look through the Iliad, and see how much and minute depicturing of a World
with which the Historian had nothing to do! Shall the Historian, in Prose,
of the Ten Years' War, stop to describe the Funeral Games of a Patroclus?
Yes; if he stop to describe the Burying of every Hero who falls. But the
Historian in Prose assumes that a People know their own Manners, and therefore
he omits painting their manners to themselves. The Historian in Verse
assumes the same thing, and, <i>therefore</i>, strange to say, he paints the manners!
See, then, in the Iliad, how much memorising of a whole departed scheme
of human existence, with which the Prose Historian had nothing to do, the
Historian in regulated Metre has had the inspiration and the skill to inweave
in the narrative of his ever-advancing Action.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_760">760</span></p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Would his lordship were with us!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Give all this to&mdash;<span class="smcap">the Hexameter</span>. Remember always, my dear Seward,

world.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Even so; for Sun, and Moon, and Stars are there, Astronomy and all the
learned sisterhood!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Then to what species of narrative in prose&mdash;to one removed at what interval
from the history of the Peloponnesian War, belongs that scene of Helen on the
Walls of Troy? That scene at the Scæan gate? In the tent of Achilles,
where Achilles sits, and Priam kneels?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Good. The general difference is obviously this&mdash;Publicity almost solely
stamps the Thucydidean story&mdash;Privacy, more than in equal part, interfused
with Publicity, the Homeric. You must allow Publicity and Privacy to signify,
besides that which is done in public and in private, that which proceeds of the
Public and of the Private will.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>In other words, if I apprehend you aright, the Theme given being some affair
of Public moment, Prose tends to gather up the acts of the individual agents,
under general aspects, into masses.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Just so. Verse, whenever it dare, resolves the mass of action into the
individual acts, puts aside the collective doer&mdash;the Public, and puts forward
individual persons. Glory, I say again, to <span class="smcap">the Hexameter</span>!</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Glory to the <span class="smcap">Hexameter</span>! The <span class="smcap">Hexameter</span>, like the Queen, has done it

<p>Or let us return to the Paradise Lost? If the mustering of the Fallen
Legions in the First Book&mdash;if the Infernal Council held in the Second&mdash;if the
Angelic Rebellion and Warfare in the Fifth and Sixth&mdash;resemble Public History,
civil and military, as we commonly speak&mdash;if the Seventh Book, relating
the Creation by describing the kinds created, be the assumption into Heroic
Poetry of Natural History&mdash;to what kind of History, I earnestly ask you
both, does that scene belong, of Eve's relation of her dream, in the Fifth
Book, and Adam's consolation of her uneasiness under its involuntary sin?
To what, in the Fourth Book, her own innocent relation of her first impressions
upon awaking into Life and Consciousness?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Ay!&mdash;to what kind of History? More easily asked than answered.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And Adam's relation to the Affable Archangel of his own suddenly-dawned
morning from the night of non-existence, aptly and happily crowned upon
the relation made to him by Raphael in the Seventh Book of his own forming
under the Omnipotent Hand?</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Simply, I venture to say, sir, to the most interior autobiography&mdash;to that
confidence of audible words, which flows when the face of a friend sharpens
the heart of a man&mdash;and Raphael was Adam's Friend.</p>

<p>Let us return to the Iliad. The Iliad is a history told by a mind that is
arbiter, to a certain extent only, of its own facts. For Homer takes his decennial
War and its Heroes, nay, the tenor of the story too, from long-descended
Tradition. To his contemporary countrymen he appears as a Historian&mdash;not
feigning, but commemorating and glorifying, transmitted facts.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Ottfried Müller, asking how far Homer is tied up in his Traditions, ventures
to suspect that the names of the Heroes whom Achilles kills, in such or such
a fight, are all traditionary.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Where, then, is the <i>Feigned</i> History? Lord Bacon, Ottfried Müller, and
Jacob Bryant, are here not in the main unagreed. "I nothing doubt," says
Bacon, "but the Fables, which Homer having received, transmits, had originally
a profound and excellent sense, although I greatly doubt if Homer any
longer knew that sense."</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>What right, may I ask, had Lord Bacon to doubt, and Ottfried Müller to
suspect&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Smoke your cigar. Ottfried Müller&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Whew!&mdash;poo!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Ottfried Müller imagines that there was in Greece a pre-Homeric Age, of
which the principal intellectual employment was Myth-making. And Bryant,
we know, shocked the opinion of his own day by referring the War of Troy
to Mythology. Now, observe, Buller, how there is feigning and feigning&mdash;Poet
after Poet&mdash;and the Poem that comes to us at last is the Poem of
Homer; but in truth, of successive ages, ending in Homer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes. <span class="smcap">The Iliad is a Tale of a Wrong Righted.</span> Zeus, upon the secret
top of Olympus, decrees this <span class="smcap">Righting</span> with his omnipotent Nod. Upon the
top of Ida he conducts it. But that is done, and the Fates resume their tenor.
Hector falls, and Troy shall fall. That is again the <span class="smcap">Righting of a Wrong</span>,

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>You are always great, sir, on Homer.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Agamemnon, in insolence of self-will, offends Chryses and a God. He refused
Chyseis&mdash;He robs Achilles. In Agamemnon the Insolence of Human
Self-will is humbled, first under the hand of Apollo&mdash;then of Jupiter&mdash;say,
altogether, of Heaven. He suffers and submits. And now Achilles, who has no
less interest in the Courts of Heaven than Chryses&mdash;indeed higher&mdash;in overweening
anger fashions out a redress for himself which the Father of Gods and
Men grants. And what follows? Agamemnon again suffers and submits.
For Achilles&mdash;Patroclus' bloody corse! Κειται Πατροκλος&mdash;that is the voice
that rings! Now he accepts the proffered reconciliation of Agamemnon, before
scornfully refused; and in the son of Thetis, too, the Insolence of Human
Self-will is chastened under the hand of Heaven.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>He suffers, but submits not till Hector lies transfixed&mdash;till Twelve noble
youths of the Trojans and their Allies have bled on Patroclus' Pyre. And
does he submit then? No. For twelve days ever and anon he drags the
insensible corse at his horses' heels round that sepulchral earth.</p>

Revenge. The Human Will, infuriated, bows under the Heavenly.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Touched by the prayers and the sight of that kneeling gray-haired Father,

<p>"Murder Impossibility," and believe that there might have been an Iliad
or a Paradise Lost in Prose.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>It could never have been, by human power, <i>our</i> Paradise Lost. What would
have become of the Seventh Book? This is now occupied with describing the
Six Days of Creation. A few verses of the First Chapter of Genesis extended
into so many hundred lines. The Book, as it stands, has full poetical reason. First,
it has a sufficient motive. It founds the existence of Adam and Eve, which is
otherwise not duly led to. The revolted Angels, you know, have fallen, and the
Almighty will create a new race of worshippers to supply their place&mdash;Mankind.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>For this race that is to be created, a Home is previously to be built&mdash;or
this World is to be created.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I initiated you into Milton nearly thirty years ago, my dear Seward; and I
rejoice to find that you still have him by heart. Between the Fall of the
Angels, and that inhabiting of Paradise by our first parents, which is
largely related by Raphael, there would be in the history which the poem
undertakes, an unfilled gap and blank without this book. The chain of events
which is unrolled would be broken&mdash;interrupted&mdash;incomplete.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>And, sir, when Raphael has told the Rebellion and Fall of the Angels,
Adam, with a natural movement of curiosity, asks of this "Divine Interpreter"
how this frame of things began?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And Raphael answers by declaring at large the Purpose and the Manner.
The Mission of Raphael is to strengthen, if it be practicable, the Human
Pair in their obedience. To this end, how apt his discourse, showing how
dear they are to the Universal Maker, how eminent in his Universe!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>The causes, then, of the Archangelic Narrative abound. And the personal
interest with which the Two Auditors must hear such a revelation of wonders
from such a Speaker, and that so intimately concerns themselves, falls nothing
short of what Poetry justly requires in relations put into the mouth of the
poetical Persons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_764">764</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And can the interest&mdash;not now of Raphael's, but of Milton's "fit audience"&mdash;be
sustained throughout? The answer is triumphant. The Book is, from
beginning to end, a stream of the most beautiful descriptive Poetry that
exists. Not however, mind you, Seward, of stationary description.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>A proceeding work is described; and the Book is replete and alive with
motion&mdash;with progress&mdash;with action&mdash;yes, of action&mdash;of an order unusual indeed
to the Epos, but unexcelled in dignity&mdash;the Creative Action of Deity!</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>What should hinder, then, but that this same Seventh Book should have been
written in Prose?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Why this only&mdash;that without Verse it could not have been read! The
Verse makes present. You listen with Adam and Eve, and you hear the
Archangel. In Prose this illusion could not have been carried through such
a subject-matter. The <i>conditio sine quâ non</i> of the Book was the ineffable
charm of the Description. But what would a series of botanical and zoological
descriptions, for instance, have been, in Prose? The <i>vivida vis</i> that is
in Verse is the quickening spirit of the whole.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>But who doubts it?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon said that Poetry&mdash;that is, Feigned History&mdash;might be worded in
Prose. And it may be; but how inadequately is known to Us Three.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>And to all the world.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>No&mdash;nor, to the million who do know it, so well as to Us, nor the reason why.
But hear me a moment longer. Wordsworth, in his famous Preface to the Lyrical
Ballads, asserts that the language of Prose and the language of Verse differ
but in this&mdash;that in verse there is metre&mdash;and metre he calls an adjunct. With
all reverence, I say that metre is not an adjunct&mdash;but vitality and essence; and
that verse, in virtue thereof, so transfigures language, that it ceases to be the
language of prose as spoken, out of verse, by any of the children of men.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Remove the metre, and the language will not be the language of prose?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Not&mdash;if you remove the metre only&mdash;and leave otherwise the order of the
words&mdash;the collocation unchanged&mdash;and unchanged any one of the two hundred
figures of speech, one and all of which are differently presented in the language
of Verse from what they are in Prose.</p>

<p>A discourse in verse resembles a billowy sea. The verses are the waves
that rise and fall&mdash;to our apprehension&mdash;each by impulse, life, will of its own.
<i>All is free.</i>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Ay. Now your meaning emerges.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p><i>E profundis clamavi.</i> In eloquent prose, the feeling fits itself into the process
of the thinking. In true verse, the thinking fits itself into the process of
the feeling.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I perpend.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>In prose, the general distribution and composition of the matter belong to
the reign of Necessity. The order of the parts, and the connexion of part with
part, are obliged&mdash;logically justifiable&mdash;say, then, are demonstrable. See an
Oration of Demosthenes. In verse, that distribution and composition belong to
the reign of Liberty. That order and connexion are arbitrary&mdash;passionately
justifiable&mdash;say, then, are delectable. See an Ode of Pindar.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Publish&mdash;publish.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>In prose the style is last&mdash;in verse first; in prose the sense controls the
sound&mdash;in verse the sound the sense; in prose you speak&mdash;in verse you sing;
in prose you live in the abstract&mdash;in verse in the concrete; in prose you present
notions&mdash;in verse visions; in prose you expound&mdash;in verse you enchant;
in prose it is much if now and then you are held in the sphere of the fascinated
senses&mdash;in verse if of the calm understanding.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Will you have the goodness, sir, to say all that over again?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I have forgot it. The lines in the countenance of Prose are austere. The look
is shy, reserved, governed&mdash;like the fixed steady lineaments of mountains. The
hues that suffuse the face of her sister Verse vary faster than those with which
the western or the eastern sky momently reports the progress of the sinking,
of the fallen, but not yet lost, of the coming or of the risen sun.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>I have jotted that down, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And I hope you will come to understand it. Candidly speaking, 'tis more
than I do.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>I do perfectly&mdash;and it is as true as beautiful, sir.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Equally so.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>I venerate Wordsworth. Wordsworth's poetry stands distinct in the world.
That which to other men is an occasional pleasure, or possibly delight, and to
other poets an occasional transport, <span class="smcap">THE SEEING THIS VISIBLE UNIVERSE</span>,
is to him&mdash;a Life&mdash;one Individual Human Life&mdash;namely, his Own&mdash;travelling
its whole Journey from the Cradle to the Grave. And that Life&mdash;for
what else could he do with it?&mdash;he has versified&mdash;sung. And there is no
other such Song. It is a Memorable Fact of our Civilisation&mdash;a Memorable
Fact in the History of Human Kind&mdash;that one perpetual song. Perpetual
but infinitely various&mdash;as a river of a thousand miles, traversing, from its
birthplace in the mountains, diverse regions, wild and inhabited, to the
ocean-receptacle.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Confoundedly prosaic at times.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>He, more than any other true poet, approaches Verse to Prose&mdash;never, I
believe, or hardly ever, quite blends them.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Often&mdash;often&mdash;often, my dear sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">766</span></p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Seldom&mdash;seldom&mdash;seldom if ever, my dear sir. He tells his Life. His
Poems are, of necessity, an Autobiography. The matter of them, then, is his
personal reality; but Prose is, all over and properly, the language of Personal
Realities. Even with him, however, so peculiarly conditioned, and, as well
as I am able to understand his Proposition, against his own Theory of writing,
Verse maintains, as by the laws of our insuppressible nature it always
will maintain, its sacred Right and indefeasible Prerogative.</p>

<p>To conclude our conversation&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Or Monologue.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Epos is Human History in its magnitude in Verse. In Prose, National
History offers itself in parallelism. The coincidence is broad and unquestioned;
but on closer inspection, differences great and innumerable spring up
and unfold themselves, until at last you might almost persuade yourself that
the first striking resemblance deceived you, and that the two species lack
analogy, so many other kinds does the Species in Verse embosom, and so
escaping are the lines of agreement in the instant in which you attempt
fixing them.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Would that Lord Bacon were here!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>And thus we are led to a deeper truth. The Metrical Epos imitates
History, without doubt, as Lord Bacon says&mdash;it borrows thence its mould,
not rigorously, but with exceeding bold and free adaptations, as the Iliad
unfolds the Ten Years' War in Seven Weeks. But for the Poet, more than
another, <span class="smcap">ALL IS IN ALL</span>.</p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Sir?</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>What is the Paradise Lost, ultimately considered?</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>It is, my friends, the arguing in verse of a question in Natural Theology.
Whence are Wrong and Pain? Moral and Physical Evil, as we call them, in
all their overwhelming extent of complexity sprung? How permitted in the
Kingdom of an All-wise and Almighty Love? To this question, concerning
the origin of Evil, Milton answers as a Christian Theologian, agreeably to his
own understanding of his Religion,&mdash;so justifying the Universal Government
of God, and, in particular, his Government of Man. The Poem is, therefore,
Theological, Argumentative, Didactic, in Epic Form. Being in the constitution
of his soul a Poet, mightiest of the mighty, the intention is hidden
in the Form. The Verse has transformed the matter. Now, then, the
Paradise Lost is not a history told for itself. But this One Truth, in two
answering Propositions, that the Will of Man spontaneously consorting with
God's Will is Man's Good, spontaneously dissenting, Man's Evil. This is
created into an awful and solemn narrative of a Matter exactly adapted, and
long since authoritatively told. But this Truth, springing up in the shape of
narrative, will now take its own determination into Events of unsurpassed
magnitude, now of the tenderest individuality and minuteness; and all is,
hence, in keeping&mdash;as one power of life springs up on one spot, in oak-tree,
moss, and violet, and the difference of stature, thus understood, gives a deep
harmony, so deep and embracing, that none without injury to the whole could
be taken away.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>What's all this! Hang that Drone&mdash;confound that Chanter. Burst, thou
most unseasonable of Bagpipes! Silence that dreadful Drum. Draw in your
Horns&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_767">767</span></p>

<p class="center">SEWARD.</p>

<p>Musquetry! cannon! huzzas! The enemy are storming the Camp. The
Delhis bear down on the Pavilion. The Life is in danger. Let us save the
King.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>See to it, gentlemen. I await the issue in my Swing-chair. Let the Barbarians
but look on me and their weapons will drop.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>All's right. A false alarm.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>There was no alarm.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>'Twas but a <span class="smcap">Salute</span>. <span class="smcap">The Boys</span> have come back from Kilchurn. They
are standing in front beside the spoil.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Widen the Portal. Artistically disposed! The Whole like one huge Star-fish.
Salmo ferox, centre&mdash;Pike, radii&mdash;Yellow-fins, circumference&mdash;Weight
I should say the tenth of a ton. Call the Manciple. Manciple, you are
responsible for the preservation of that Star-fish.</p>

<p class="center">BULLER.</p>

<p>Sir, you forget yourself. The People must be fed. We are Seven. Twelve
are on the Troop Roll&mdash;Nine Strangers have sent in their cards&mdash;the Gillies
are growing upon us&mdash;the Camp-followers have doubled the population since
morn, and the circumambient Natives are waxing strong. Hunger is in the
Camp&mdash;but for this supply, Famine; <i>Iliacos intra muros</i> <span class="smcap">PECCATUR</span> <i>et extra</i>;
Dods reports that the Boiler is wroth, the Furnace at a red heat, Pots and
Pans a-simmer&mdash;the Culinary Spirit impatient to be at work. In such circumstances,
the tenth of a ton is no great matter; but it is better than nothing.
The mind of the Manciple may lie at rest, for that Star-fish will
never see to-morrow's Sun; and motionless as he looks, he is hastening to the
Shades.</p>

<p class="center">NORTH.</p>

<p>Sir, you forget yourself. There is other animal matter in the world besides
Fish. No penury of it in camp. I have here the Manciple's report. "One
dozen plucked Earochs&mdash;one ditto ditto Ducklings&mdash;d. d. d. March Chick&mdash;one
Bubblyjock&mdash;one Side of Mutton&mdash;four Necks&mdash;six Sheep-heads, and their
complement of Trotters&mdash;two Sheep, just slaughtered and yet in wholes&mdash;four

<p>Stop. Let that suffice for the meanwhile.</p>

<p>The short shadow-hand on the face of Dial-Cruachan, to my instructed sense,

In primitive villages in the west of England, the belief that the absent may be
seen in a piece of crystal is, or was not many years ago, by no means an uncommon
superstition. I have seen more than one of these magic mirrors, which Spenser, by

egg. It is not every one, however, who can be a crystal-seer; like second-sight, it is
a special gift.</p></div>

a part of the Beautiful.</p></div>
